Upgrading notes
===============
endif::txt[]

This file lists changes that affect users who installed older versions
of this software.  When upgrading from an older version, be sure to
check this file to see if you need to make changes to your system.

[NOTE]
======
For packaging (OS distribution or in-house) it is recommended to
primarily `./configure --with-all` and then excise `--without-something`
explicitly for items not supported on your platform, so you do not miss
out on new NUT features as they come with new releases. Some may require
that you update your build environment with new third-party dependencies,
so a broken build of a new NUT release would let you know how to act.

This is a good time to point out that for stricter packaging systems, it may
be beneficial to add `--enable-option-checking=fatal` to the `./configure`
command line, in order to quickly pick up any other removed option flags.
======

Changes from 2.8.2 to 2.8.3
---------------------------

- PLANNED: Keep track of any further API clean-up?

- NUT development snapshots can now have more version components than the
  standard semantic versioning triplet, optionally adding the amount of
  commits on the development trunk since previous release, and the amount
  of commits on a feature branch that are unique to it.  Release artifacts
  that have zeroes in both positions would have them stripped and still
  have the standard "semver" exposed, but the development snapshots can
  now be more reasonably upgraded with automated tooling. A copy of the
  current version information would be embedded into "dist" archives as
  a `VERSION_DEFAULT` file, so it can be used without git. Certain distros
  can benefit from a `VERSION_FORCED` file or a `NUT_VERSION_FORCED`
  environment variable exported from their build system, e.g. via
  `echo NUT_VERSION_FORCED=1.1.1 > VERSION_FORCED`. Unfortunately, some
  appliances tag all software the same with their firmware version;
  if this is required, a (NUT_)VERSION_FORCED_SEMVER envvar or file can
  help identify the actual NUT release version triplet used on the box.
  Please use it, it immensely helps with community troubleshooting!
  [issue #1949]

- `upsmon` should now integrate natively with systemd-driven OS sleep events
  (built with systemd version 221 or newer "inhibitor interface"), so various
  hacks previously packaged into `/usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/` scripts or
  units requiring/conflicting with the `sleep.target` may be obsolete.
  For fallback with older systemd, a `nut-sleep.service` is provided now.
  [#1070, #2596, #2597]

- Handling of per-UPS `ALARM` state was introduced to `upsmon`, allowing it
  to optionally treat it as a factor in deciding that the device is in a
  "critical" state (polled more often, assumed dead if communications are
  lost). Since it is up to devices and their NUT drivers what they would
  raise as an alarm (might be something as mundane as ECO mode being active),
  some alarms can contribute to unwanted/early shutdowns. For this reason
  a `0|1` setting `ALARMCRITICAL` was introduced into `upsmon.conf` (default
  is `1`), for such users to be able to prevent their `upsmon` from treating
  the `ALARM` status as overly severe when it is not in fact. [#2658]

- `usbhid-ups` subdriver `PowerCOM HID` subdriver sent UPS `shutdown` and
  `stayoff` commands in wrong byte order, at least for devices currently
  in the field. Driver now sends the commands in a way that satisfies new
  devices; just in case a flag toggle `powercom_sdcmd_byte_order_fallback`
  was added to set the old behavior (if some devices do need it). [PR #2480]

- Added support for `lbrb_log_delay_sec=N` setting to delay propagation of
  `LB` or `LB+RB` state (buggy with APC BXnnnnMI devices/firmwares issued
  circa 2023-2024 which flood the logs with spurious LOWBATT and REPLACEBATT
  events). This may work better for some devices when combined with flags
  like `onlinedischarge_calibration` and `lbrb_log_delay_without_calibrating`.
  [#2347]

- Enabled installation of built PDF and HTML (including man page renditions)
  files under the configured `docdir`. It seems previously they were only
  built (if requested) but not installed via `make`, unlike the common man
  pages which are delivered automatically. Packaging recipes can likely
  be simplified now. [#2445]

- A `NUT_DEBUG_SYSLOG` environment variable was introduced to tweak activation
  of syslog message emission (and related detachment of `stderr` when daemons
  are backgrounding), which can be useful for systemd service units. It can be
  set via `nut.conf` file for all standard consumers, or patched/dropped-in to
  systemd unit definitions specifically (less recommended, but may be easier
  to package). The positive effect would be avoiding duplicate logging as both
  `syslog` and `stderr` ending up in the same journal. [#2394]

- A `CHANGELOG_REQUIRE_GROUP_BY_DATE_AUTHOR` setting was added (for `make`
  calls and used by `tools/gitlog2changelog.py.in` script), and it defaults
  to `true` allowing for better ordered documents at the cost of some memory
  during document generation. Resource-constrained builders (working from
  a Git workspace, not tarball archives) may have to set it to `false` when
  calling `make` for NUT. [#2510]

- NUT products like `nut-scanner`, which dynamically load shared libraries
  at run-time without persistent pre-linking, should now know the library
  file names that were present during build (likely encumbered with version
  suffixes), and prefer them over plain `libname.so` patterns used previously
  (which on some platforms are only delivered by development packages as
  symlinks). Packaging recipes can likely be simplified now: some distros
  certainly did patch NUT source to similar effect). [#2431]

- Numerous changes to `nut-scanner` and symbols that its `libnutscan.so`
  delivers have caused a library version bump.  New methods have been added
  and one structure (`nutscan_ipmi_t`) updated in a (hopefully) backwards
  compatible manner. [PR #2523, issue #2244 and numerous PRs for it]

- Internal API change for `sendsignalpid()` and `sendsignalfn()` methods,
  which can impact NUT forks which build using `libcommon.la` and similar
  libraries.  Added new last argument with `const char *progname` (may be
  `NULL`) to check that we are signalling an expected program name when we
  work with a PID.  With the same effort, NUT programs which deal with PID
  files to send signals (`upsd`, `upsmon`, drivers and `upsdrvctl`) would
  now default to a safety precaution -- checking that the running process
  with that PID has the expected program name (on platforms where we can
  determine one). This might introduce regressions for heavily customized
  NUT builds (e.g. embedded in NAS or similar devices) whose binary file
  names differ significantly from a `progname` defined in the respective
  NUT source file, so a boolean `NUT_IGNORE_CHECKPROCNAME` environment
  variable support was added to optionally disable this verification.
  Also the NUT daemons should request to double-check against their
  run-time process name (if it can be detected). [issue #2463]

- More environment variable support was added to NUT programs, primarily
  aimed at wrappers such as init scripts and service unit definitions,
  allowing to tweak what (and whether) they write into debug traces, and
  so "make noise" or "bring invaluable insights" to logs or terminal;
  they can generally be used for services and init scripts via `nut.conf`:
  * See `NUT_IGNORE_CHECKPROCNAME` and `NUT_DEBUG_SYSLOG` above. [#1915]
  * A `NUT_QUIET_INIT_BANNER` envvar (presence or "true" value) prevents
    tool name and NUT version banner from being printed out when programs
    start. [issues #1789 vs. #316]

- A `configure` script option to `--enable-NUT_STRARG-always` was added
  to enable the `NUT_STRARG` macro (to handle `NULL` string printing)
  even if system libraries seem to safely support this behavior natively.
  This should primarily help against overly zealous static analysis tools
  in recent compiler generations. [#2585]


Changes from 2.8.1 to 2.8.2
---------------------------

- Builds requested with a specific C/C++ language standard revision via
  `CFLAGS` and `CXXFLAGS` should again be honoured. There was a mishap
  with the `m4` scripting for `autoconf` which could have caused use of
  C11/C++11 if compiler supported it, regardless of a request. [PR #2306]

- Added generation of FreeBSD/pfSense quirks for USB devices supported
  by NUT (may get installed to `$datadir` e.g. `/usr/local/share/nut`
  and need to be pasted into your `/boot/loader.conf.local`). [#2159]

- nut-scanner now does not propose active `bus`, `busport` and `device`
  values when generating device configurations by default. They may
  appear as comments, or enabled by specifying the `-U` command-line
  option several times. [#2221]

- The `tools/gitlog2changelog.py.in` script was revised, in particular to
  convert section titles (with contributor names) into plain ASCII character
  set, for `dblatex` versions which do not allow diacritics and other kinds
  of non-trivial characters in sections. A number of other projects seem to
  use the NUT version of the script, and are encouraged to look at related
  changes in `configure.ac` and `Makefile.am` recipes. [PR #2360, PR #2366]

Changes from 2.8.0 to 2.8.1
---------------------------

- NUT documentation recipes were revised, so many of the text source files
  were renamed to `*.adoc` pattern. Newly, a `release-notes.pdf` and HTML
  equivalents are generated. Packages which deliver documentation may need
  to update the lists of files to ship. [#1953] Developers may be impacted
  by new `configure --enable-spellcheck` toggle (should add spelling checks
  to `make check` by default, if tools are available) to facilitate quicker
  acceptance of contributions. Packaging systems may now want to explicitly
  disable it, if it blocks package building (pull requests to update the
  `docs/nut.dict` are a better and welcome solution). [#2067]

- Several improvements regarding simultaneous support of USB devices that
  were previously deemed "identical" and so NUT driver instances did not
  start for all of them:

  * Some more drivers should now use the common USB device matching logic
    and the 7 `ups.conf` options for that [#1763], and man pages were
    updated to reflect that [#1766];

  * The `nut-scanner` tool should suggest these options in its generated
    device configuration [#1790]: hopefully these would now suffice for
    sufficiently unique combinations;

  * The `nut-scanner` tool should also suggest sanity-check violations
    as comments in its generated device configuration [#1810], e.g. bogus
    or duplicate serial number values;

  * The common USB matching logic was updated with an `allow_duplicates`
    flag (caveat emptor!) which may help monitor several related no-name
    devices on systems that do not discern "bus" and "device" values
    (although without knowing reliably which one is which... sometimes it
    is better than nothing) [#1756].

- Work on NUT for Windows branch led to situation-specific definitions of
  what in POSIX code was all "file descriptors" (an `int` type). Now such
  entities are named `TYPE_FD`, `TYPE_FD_SER` or `TYPE_FD_SOCK` with some
  helper macros to name and determine "invalid" values (closed file, etc.)
  Some of these changes happened in NUT header files, and at this time it
  was not investigated whether the set of files delivered for third-party
  code integration (e.g. C/C++ projects binding with `libnutclient` or
  `libupsclient) is consistent or requires additional definitions/files.
  If something gets broken by this, it is a bug to address in future [#1556]

- Further revision of public headers delivered by NUT was done, particularly
  to address lack of common data types (`size_t`, `ssize_t`, `uint16_t`,
  `time_t` etc.) in third-party client code that earlier sufficed to only
  include NUT headers. Sort of regression by NUT 2.8.0 (note those consumers
  still have to re-declare some numeric variable types used) [#1638]

  * For practical example of NUT consumer adaptation (to cater to both old and
    new API types) please see https://github.com/collectd/collectd/pull/4043

- Added support for `make install` of PyNUT module and NUT-Monitor desktop
  application -- such activity was earlier done by packages directly; now
  the packaging recipes may use NUT source-code facilities and package just
  symlinks as relevant for each distro separately [#1462, #1504]

- The `upsd.conf` listing of `LISTEN` addresses was previously inverted
  (the last listed address was applied first), which was counter-intuitive
  and fixed for this release. If user configurations somehow relied on this
  order (e.g. to prioritize IPv6 vs IPv4 listeners), configuration changes
  may be needed. [#2012]

- The `upsd` configured to listen on IPv6 addresses should handle only
  IPv6 (and not IPv4-mappings like it might have done before) to avoid
  surprises and insecurity -- if user configurations somehow relied on
  this dual support, configuration changes may be needed to specify both
  desired IP addresses. Note that the daemon logs will now warn if a
  host name resolves to several addresses (and will only listen on the
  first hit, as it did before in such cases). [#2012]

- A definitive behavior for `LISTEN *` directives became specified, to try
  handling both IPv4 and IPv6 "any" address (subject to `upsd` CLI options
  to only choose one, and to OS abilities). This use-case may be practically
  implemented as a single IPv6 socket on systems with enabled and required
  IPv4-mapped IPv6 address support, or as two separate listening sockets -
  logged messages to this effect (e.g. inability to listen on IPv4 after
  opening IPv6) are expected on some platforms. End-users may also want to
  reconfigure their `upsd.conf` files to remove some now-redundant `LISTEN`
  lines. [#2012]

- Added support for `make sockdebug` for easier developer access to the tool;
  also if `configure --with-dev` is in effect, it would now be installed to
  the configured `libexec` location. A man page was also added. [#1936]

- NUT software-only drivers (dummy-ups, clone, clone-outlet) separated from
  serial drivers in respective Makefile and configure script options - this
  may impact packaging decisions on some distributions going forward [#1446]

- GPIO category of drivers was added (`--with-gpio` configure script option) -
  this may impact packaging decisions on some (currently Linux released 2018+)
  distributions going forward [#1855]

- An explicit `configure --with-nut-scanner` toggle was added, specifically
  so that build environments requesting `--with-all` but lacking `libltdl`
  would abort and require the packager either to install the dependency
  or explicitly forfeit building the tool (some distro packages missed it
  quietly in the past) [#1560]

- An `upsdebugx_report_search_paths()` method in NUT common code was added,
  and exposed in `libnutscan.so` builds in particular - API version for the
  public library was bumped [#317]

- Some environment variable support was added to NUT programs, primarily
  aimed at wrappers such as init scripts and service unit definitions,
  allowing to tweak what (and whether) they write into debug traces, and
  so "make noise" or "bring invaluable insights" to logs or terminal:
  * A `NUT_DEBUG_LEVEL=NUM` envvar allows to temporarily boost debugging
    of many daemons (`upsd`, `upsmon`, drivers, `upsdrvctl`, `upssched`)
    without changes to configuration files or scripted command lines. [#1915]
  * A `NUT_DEBUG_PID` envvar (presence) support was added to add current
    process ID to tags with debug-level identifiers. This may be useful
    when many NUT daemons write to the same console or log file, such as
    in containers/plugins for Home Assistant, storage appliances, etc. [#2118]
  * A `NUT_QUIET_INIT_SSL` envvar (presence or "true" value) prevents
    `libupsclient` consumers (notoriously `upsc`) from reporting whether
    they have initialized SSL support. [#1662]
  * A `NUT_QUIET_INIT_UPSNOTIFY` envvar (presence or "true" value)
    prevents daemons which can notify service management frameworks (such
    as systemd) about passing their lifecycle milestones, to not report
    loudly if they could not do so (e.g. running on a system without a
    framework, or misconfigured so they could not report and the OS would
    restart the false-positively "unresponsive" service). [#2136]

- `configure` script, reference init-script and packaging templates updated
  to eradicate `@PIDPATH@/nut` ambiguity in favor of `@ALTPIDPATH@` for the
  unprivileged processes vs. `@PIDPATH@` for those running as root [#1719]

- The "layman report" of NUT configuration options displayed after the run
  of `configure` script can now be retained and installed by using the
  `--enable-keep_nut_report_feature` option; packagers are welcome to make
  use of this, to better keep track of their deliveries [#1826, #1708]

- Renamed generated nut-common.tmpfiles(.in) => nut-common-tmpfiles.conf(.in)
  to install a /usr/lib/systemd-tmpfiles/*.conf pattern [#1755]

  * If earlier NUT v2.8.0 package recipes for your Linux distribution dealt
    with this file, you may have to adjust its name for newer releases.

  * Several other issues have been fixed related to this file and its content,
    including #1030, #1037, #1117 and #1712

- Extended Linux systemd support with optional notifications about daemon
  state (READY, RELOADING, STOPPING) and watchdog keep-alive messages.
  Note that `WatchdogSec=` values are currently NOT pre-set into systemd
  unit file templates provided by NUT, this is an exercise for end-users
  based on sizing of their deployments and performance of monitoring station
  [#1590, #1777]

- snmp-ups: some subdrivers (addressed using the driver parameter `mibs`)
  were renamed: `pw` is now `eaton_pw_nm2`, and `pxgx_ups` is `eaton_pxg_ups`
  [#1715]

- The `tools/gitlog2changelog.py.in` script was revised, in particular to
  generate the `ChangeLog` file more consistently with different versions
  of Python interpreter, and without breaking the long file paths in the
  resulting mark-up text. Due to this, a copy of this file distributed with
  NUT release archives is expected to considerably differ on first glance
  from its earlier released versions (not just adding lines for the new
  release, but changing lines in the older releases too) [#1945, #1955]

Changes from 2.7.4 to 2.8.0
---------------------------

- Note to distribution packagers: this version hopefully learns from many
  past mistakes, so many custom patches may be no longer needed. If some
  remain, please consider making pull requests for upstream NUT codebase
  to share the fixes consistently across the ecosystem. Also note that
  some new types of drivers (so package groups with unique dependencies)
  could have appeared since your packaging was written (e.g. with modbus),
  as well as new features in systemd integration (`nut-driver@instances`
  and the `nut-driver-enumerator` to manage their population), as well as
  updated Python 2 and Python 3 support (again, maybe dictating different
  package groups) as detailed below.

- Due to changes needed to resolve build warnings, mostly about mismatching
  data types for some variables, some structure definitions and API signatures
  of several routines had to be changed for argument types, return types,
  or both. Primarily this change concerns internal implementation details
  (may impact update of NUT forks with custom drivers using those), but a
  few changes also happened in header files installed for builds configured
  `--with-dev` and so may impact `upsclient` and `nutclient` (C++) consumers.
  At the very least, binaries for those consumers should be rebuilt to remain
  stable with NUT 2.8.0 and not mismatch int-type sizes and other arguments.

- libusb-1.0: NUT now defaults to building against libusb-1.0 API version
  if the configure script finds the development headers, falling back to
  libusb-0.1 if not. Please report any regressions.

- apcupsd-ups: When monitoring a remote apcupsd server, interpret "SHUTTING
  DOWN" as a NUT "LB" status. If you were relying on the previous behavior
  (for instance, in a monitor-only situation), please adjust your upsmon
  settings. Reference: https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/460

- Packagers: the AsciiDoc detection has been reworked to allow NUT to be built
  from source without requiring asciidoc/a2x (using pre-built man pages from
  the distribution tarball, for instance). Please double-check that we did not
  break anything (see docs/configure.txt for options).

- Driver core: options added for standalone mode (scanning for devices without
  requiring ups.conf) - see docs/man/nutupsdrv.txt for details.

- oldmge-shut has been removed, and replaced by mge-shut.

- New drivers for devices with "Qx" (also known as "Megatec Q*") family of
  protocols should be developed as sub-drivers in the `nutdrv_qx` framework
  for USB and Serial connected devices, not as updates/clones of older e.g.
  `blazer` family and `bestups`. Sources, man pages and start-up messages
  of such older drivers were marked with "OBSOLETION WARNING".

- liebert-esp2: some multi-phase variable names have been updated to match the
  rest of NUT.

- netxml-ups: if you have old firmware, or were relying on values being off by
  a factor of 10, consider the `do_convert_deci` flag. See
  docs/man/netxml-ups.txt for details.

- snmp-ups: detection of Net-SNMP has been updated to use `pkg-config` by
  default (if present), rather than `net-snmp-config(-32|-64)` script(s) as
  the only option available previously. The scripts tend to specify a lot
  of options (sometimes platform-specific) in suggested `CFLAGS` and `LIBS`
  compared to the packaged `pkg-config` information which also works and is
  more portable. If this change bites your distribution, please bring it up
  in https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues or better yet, post a PR.
  Also note that `./configure --with-netsnmp-config(=yes)` should set up the
  preference of the detected script over `pkg-config` information, if both
  are available, and `--with-netsnmp-config=/path/name` would as well.

- snmp-ups: bit mask values for flags in earlier codebase were defined in a
  way that caused logically different items to have same numeric values.
  This was fixed to surely use different definitions (so changing numbers
  behind some of those macro symbols), and testing with UPS, ePDU and ATS
  hardware which was available did not expose any practical differences.

- usbhid-ups: numeric data conversion from wire protocol to CPU representation
  in GetValue() was completely reworked, aiming to be correct on all CPU types.
  That said, regressions are possible and feedback is welcome.

- nut-scanner: Packagers, take note of the changes to the library
  search code in common/common.c. Please file an issue if this does not work
  with your platform.

- dummy-ups can now specify `mode` as a driver argument, and separates the
  notion of `dummy-once` (new default for `\*.dev` files that do not change)
  vs. `dummy-loop` (legacy default for `*.seq` and others) [issue #1385]

  * Note this can break third-party test scripts which expected `*.dev`
    files to work as a looping sequence with a `TIMER` keywords to change
    values slowly; now such files should get processed to the end once.
    Specify `mode=dummy-loop` driver option or rename the data file used
    in the `port` option for legacy behavior.
    Use/Test-cases which modified such files content externally should
    not be impacted.

- Python: scripts have been updated to work with Python 3 as well as 2.

  * PyNUT module (protocol binding) supports both Python generations.

  * NUT-Monitor (desktop UI client) got separated into two projects:
    one with support for Python2 and GTK2, and another for Python3 and Qt5.
    On operating systems that serve both environments, either of these
    implementation should be usable. For distributions that deprecated
    and removed Python2 support, it is a point to consider in NUT packages
    and their build-time and installation dependencies.
    The historic filenames for desktop integration (`NUT-Monitor` script
    and `nut-monitor.desktop`) are still delivered, but now cover a wrapper
    script which detects the environment capabilities and launches the best
    suitable UI implementation (if both are available).

- apcsmart: updates to CS "hack" (see docs/man/apcsmart.txt for details)

- upsdebugx(): added `[D#]` prefix to log entries with level > 0
  so if any scripts or other tools relied on parsing those messages
  making some assumptions, they should be updated

- upsdebugx() and related methods are now macros, optionally calling similarly
  named implementations like s_upsdebugx() as a slight optimization; this may
  show up in linking of binaries for some customized build scenarios

- libraries, tools and protocol now support a `TRACKING` ID to be used with
  an `INSTCMD` or `SET VAR` requests; for details see docs/net-protocol.txt
  and docs/sock-protocol.txt

- upsrw: display the variable type beside ENUM / RANGE

- Augeas: new `--with-augeas-lenses-dir` configure option.

Changes from 2.7.3 to 2.7.4
---------------------------

- scripts/systemd/nut-server.service.in: Restore systemd relationship since it
  was preventing upsd from starting whenever one or more drivers, among several,
  was failing to start

- Fix UPower device matching for recent kernels, since hiddev* devices now have
  class "usbmisc", rather than "usb"

- macosx-ups: the "port" driver option no longer has any effect

- Network protocol information: default to type NUMBER for variables that are
  not flagged as STRING . This point is subject to improvements or change in
  the next release 2.7.5.  Refer to docs/net-protocol.txt for more information

Changes from 2.7.2 to 2.7.3
---------------------------

- The linkman:nutdrv_qx[8] driver will eventually supersede linkman:bestups[8].
  It has been tested on a U-series Patriot Pro II. Please test the new driver
  on your hardware during your next maintenance window, and report any bugs.

- If you are upgrading from a new install of 2.7.1 or 2.7.2, double-check the
  value of POWERDOWNFLAG in $prefix/etc/upsmon.conf - it has been restored to
  /etc/killpower as in 2.6.5 and earlier.

- If you use upslog with a large sleep value, you may be interested in adding
  `killall -SIGUSR1 upslog` to any OB/OL script actions. This will force
  upslog to write a log entry to catch short power transients.

- Be sure that your SSL keys are readable by the NUT system user. The SSL
  subsystem is now initialized after `upsd` forks, to work around issues in the
  NSS library.

- The systemd nut-server.service does not Require nut-driver to be started
  successfully.  This was previously preventing upsd startup, even for just
  one driver failure among many.  This also matches the behavior of sysV
  initscripts.

Changes from 2.7.1 to 2.7.2
---------------------------

- upsdrvctl is now installed to $prefix/sbin rather than $driverexec.
  This usually means moving from /bin to /sbin, apart from few exceptions.
  In all cases, please adapt your scripts.

- FreeDesktop Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) support was removed.
  Please adapt your packaging files, if you used to distribute the
  nut-hal-drivers package.

- This is a good time to point out that for stricter packaging systems, it may
  be beneficial to add "--enable-option-checking=fatal" to the ./configure
  command line, in order to quickly pick up any other removed option flags.

Changes from 2.6.5 to 2.7.1
---------------------------

- The linkman:apcsmart[8] driver has been replaced by a new implementation. There is a new
  parameter, 'ttymode', which may help if you have a non-standard serial port,
  or Windows.  In case of issues with this new version, users can revert to
  apcsmart-old.

- The linkman:nutdrv_qx[8] driver will eventually supersede blazer_ser and blazer_usb.
  Options are not exactly the same, but are documented in the nutdrv_qx man
  page.

- Mozilla NSS support has been added. The OpenSSL configuration options should
  be unchanged, but please refer to the linkman:upsd.conf[5] and
  linkman:upsmon.conf[5] documentation in case we missed something.

- linkman:upsrw[8] now prints out the maximum size of variables. Hopefully you
  are not parsing the output of upsrw - it would be easier to use one of the
  NUT libraries, or implement the network protocol yourself.

- The jNut source is now here: https://github.com/networkupstools/jNut

Changes from 2.6.4 to 2.6.5
---------------------------

- users are encouraged to update to NUT 2.6.5, to fix a regression in
  upssched.

- mge-shut driver has been replaced by a new implementation (newmge-shut).
  In case of issue with this new version, users can revert to oldmge-shut.
  UPDATE: oldmge-shut was dropped between 2.7.4 and 2.8.0 releases.

Changes from 2.6.3 to 2.6.4
---------------------------

- users are encouraged to update to NUT 2.6.4, to fix upsd vulnerability
  (CVE-2012-2944: upsd can be remotely crashed).

- users of the bestups driver are encouraged to switch to blazer_ser,
  since bestups will soon be deprecated.

Changes from 2.6.2 to 2.6.3
---------------------------

- nothing that affects upgraded systems.

Changes from 2.6.1 to 2.6.2
---------------------------

- apcsmart driver has been replaced by a new implementation. In case of issue
  with this new version, users can revert to apcsmart-old.

Changes from 2.6.0 to 2.6.1
---------------------------

- nothing that affects upgraded systems.

Changes from 2.4.3 to 2.6.0
---------------------------

- users of the megatec and megatec_usb drivers must respectively switch to
  blazer_ser and blazer_usb.

- users of the liebertgxt2 driver are advised that the driver name has changed
  to liebert-esp2.

Changes from 2.4.2 to 2.4.3
---------------------------

- nothing that affects upgraded systems.

Changes from 2.4.1 to 2.4.2
---------------------------

- The default subdriver for the blazer_usb driver USB id 06da:0003 has changed.
  If you use such a device and it is no longer working with this driver,
  override the 'subdriver' default in 'ups.conf' (see man 8 blazer).

- NUT ACL and the allowfrom mechanism has been replaced in 2.4.0 by the LISTEN
  directive and tcp-wrappers respectively. This information was missing below,
  so a double note has been added.

Changes from 2.4.0 to 2.4.1
---------------------------

- nothing that affects upgraded systems.

Changes from 2.2.2 to 2.4.0
---------------------------

- The nut.conf file has been introduced to standardize startup configuration
  across the various systems.

- The cpsups and nitram drivers have been replaced by the powerpanel driver,
  and removed from the tree. The cyberpower driver may suffer the same in the
  future.

- The al175 and energizerups drivers have been removed from the tree, since
  these were tagged broken for a long time.

- Developers of external client application using libupsclient must rename
  their "UPSCONN" client structure to "UPSCONN_t".

- The upsd server will now disconnect clients that remain silent for more than
  60 seconds.

- The files under scripts/python/client are distributed under GPL 3+, whereas
  the rest of the files are distributed under GPL 2+. Refer to COPYING for more
  information.

- The generated udev rules file has been renamed with dash only, no underscore
  anymore (i.e. 52-nut-usbups.rules instead of 52_nut-usbups.rules)

Changes from 2.2.1 to 2.2.2
---------------------------

- The configure option "--with-lib" has been replaced by "--with-dev".
  This enable the additional build and distribution of the static
  version of libupsclient, along with the pkg-config helper and manual
  pages. The default configure option is to distribute only the shared
  version of libupsclient. This can be overridden by using the
  "--disable-shared" configure option (distribute static only binaries).

- The UPS poweroff handling of the usbhid-ups driver has been reworked.
  Though regression is not expected, users of this driver are
  encouraged to test this feature by calling "upsmon -c fsd" and
  report any issue on the NUT mailing lists.

Changes from 2.2.0 to 2.2.1
---------------------------

- nothing that affects upgraded systems.
  (The below message is repeated due to previous omission)

- Developers of external client application using libupsclient are
  encouraged to rename their "UPSCONN" client structure to "UPSCONN_t"
  since the former will disappear by the release of NUT 2.4.

Changes from 2.0.5 to 2.2.0
---------------------------

- users of the newhidups driver are advised that the driver name has changed
  to usbhid-ups.

- users of the hidups driver must switch to usbhid-ups.

- users of the following drivers (powermust, blazer, fentonups, mustek,
  esupssmart, ippon, sms) must switch to megatec, which replaces
  all these drivers.  Please refer to doc/megatec.txt for details.

- users of the mge-shut driver are encouraged to test newmge-shut, which
  is an alternate driver scheduled to replace mge-shut,

- users of the cpsups driver are encouraged to switch to powerpanel which
  is scheduled to replace cpsups,

- packagers will have to rework the whole nut packaging due to the
  major changes in the build system (completely modified, and now using
  automake). Refer to packaging/debian/ for an example of migration.

- specifying '-a <id>' is now mandatory when starting a driver manually,
  i.e. not using upsdrvctl.

- Developers of external client application using libupsclient are
  encouraged to rename the "UPSCONN" client structure to "UPSCONN_t"
  since the former will disappear by the release of NUT 2.4.

Changes from 2.0.4 to 2.0.5
---------------------------

- users of the newhidups driver: the driver is now more strict about
  refusing to connect to unknown devices. If your device was
  previously supported, but fails to be recognized now, add
  'productid=XXXX' to ups.conf. Please report the device to the NUT
  developer's mailing list.

Changes from 2.0.3 to 2.0.4
---------------------------

- nothing that affects upgraded systems.

- users of the following drivers (powermust, blazer, fentonups, mustek,
  esupssmart, ippon, sms, masterguard) are encouraged to switch to megatec,
  which should replace all these drivers by nut 2.2. For more information,
  please refer to doc/megatec.txt

Changes from 2.0.2 to 2.0.3
---------------------------

- nothing that affects upgraded systems.

- hidups users are encouraged to switch to newhidups, as hidups will be
  removed by nut 2.2.

Changes from 2.0.1 to 2.0.2
---------------------------

- The newhidups driver, which is the long run USB support approach,
  needs hotplug files installed to setup the right permissions on
  device file to operate. Check newhidups manual page for more information.

Changes from 2.0.0 to 2.0.1
---------------------------

- The cyberpower1100 driver is now called cpsups since it supports
  more than just one model.  If you use this driver, be sure to remove
  the old binary and update your ups.conf 'driver=' setting with the
  new name.

- The upsstats.html template page has been changed slightly to reflect
  better HTML compliance, so you may want to update your installed copy
  accordingly.  If you've customized your file, don't just copy the new
  one over it, or your changes will be lost!

Changes from 1.4.0 to 2.0.0
---------------------------

- The sample config files are no longer installed by default.  If you
  want to install them, use 'make install-conf' for the main programs,
  and 'make install-cgi-conf' for the CGI programs.

- ACCESS is no longer supported in upsd.conf.  Use ACCEPT and REJECT.

  * Old way:
+
	ACCESS grant all adminbox
	ACCESS grant all webserver
	ACCESS deny all all

  * New way:
+
	ACCEPT adminbox
	ACCEPT webserver
	REJECT all

  * Note that ACCEPT and REJECT can take multiple arguments, so this
    will also work:
+
	ACCEPT adminbox webserver
	REJECT all

- The drivers no longer support sddelay in ups.conf or -d on the
  command line.  If you need a delay after calling 'upsdrvctl
  shutdown', add a call to sleep in your shutdown script.

- The templates used by upsstats have changed considerably to reflect
  the new variable names.  If you use upsstats, you will need to
  install new copies or edit your existing files to use the new names.

- Nobody needed UDP mode, so it has been removed.  The only users
  seemed to be a few people like me with ancient asapm-ups binaries.
  If you really want to run asapm-ups again, bug me for the new patch
  which makes it work with upsclient.

- 'make install-misc' is now 'make install-lib'.  The misc directory
  has been gone for a long time, and the target was ambiguous.

- The newapc driver has been renamed to apcsmart.  If you previously
  used newapc, make sure you delete the old binary and fix your
  ups.conf.  Otherwise, you may run the old driver from 1.4.

File trimmed here on changes from 1.2.2 to 1.4.0
------------------------------------------------

For information before this point, start with version 2.4.1 and work back.

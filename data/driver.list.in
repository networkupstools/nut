# Network UPS Tools - @PACKAGE_VERSION@ - Hardware Compatibility List
# version=2
#
# This file is used for various purposes, like building the HTML compatibility
# list or displaying information in NUT configuration tools.
#
# If you write a new driver, modify an existing one to add more support,
# or just know about some equipment that isn't listed but should be,
# please send us a patch to update this file.
#
# Format:
# =======
# <manufacturer>	<device type>	<support level>	<model name>	<model extra>	<driver [parameters]>
#
# Details:
# ========
# - device type:
#   "ups" for Uninterruptible Power Supply
#   "pdu" for Power Distributions Unit
#   "scd" for Solar Controlers Device
#   "ats" for Automatic Transfer Switch
#
# - support level: a number from "1" to "5" (stars) meaning:
#   *       protocol based on reverse engineering
#   **      based on fragments of publicly available protocol
#   ***     based on publicly available protocol
#   ****    vendor provided protocol
#   *****   vendor provided protocol and hardware
#
# - driver [parameters]: mention the driver(s) (separated by "or" if there are
#   several possibilities). Any mandatory parameter(s) must be referenced, as
#   they will be parsed by configuration helper software.
#   For example, genericups entries must mention the "upstype=nn" format.
#
# Duplicate text in the last field will be cooked out during the conversion
# to HTML with ROWSPAN magic.  They must be an exact match for this to work.

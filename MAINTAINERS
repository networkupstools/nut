In the tradition of stealing ideas for top-level files from the Linux
kernel tree, here is the NUT MAINTAINERS file.  This file is intended to
help patch contributors route their changes to the right people.

Note: just because something isn't listed in here doesn't mean it's not
being maintained.  It just means that the maintainer hasn't sent me a
patch to update this file yet.

Note 2: there are always other people who work on a project beyond those
who are listed here.  Omission from this list should not be taken as a
slight.  Those who are listed below are merely volunteering to be the
"lightning rods" for patches to certain parts of the tree.

Fields
======

P: Person
M: Mail patches to this address
W: Web address
S: Status:

   Supported  = someone is paid to do this

In the case of drivers, "maintained" should only be used if you have
access to the hardware in question for testing.

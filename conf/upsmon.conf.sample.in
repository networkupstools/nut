# Network UPS Tools: example upsmon configuration
#
# This file contains passwords, so keep it secure.
#
# NOTE: Contents of this file should be pure ASCII (character codes
# not in range would be ignored with a warning message).
#
# A minimal configuration should include at least one MONITOR instruction,
# MINSUPPLIES (may be 0 if this system is only monitoring other NUT servers),
# and a POWERDOWNFLAG if this machine is a "primary" system connected to
# the UPS and drives its late-shutdown power-off command in an emergency.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# RUN_AS_USER <userid>
#
# By default, upsmon splits into two processes.  One stays as root and
# waits to run the SHUTDOWNCMD.  The other one switches to another userid
# and does everything else.
#
# The default unprivileged user is set at compile-time with the option
#   'configure --with-user=...'
#
# You can override it with '-u <user>' when starting upsmon, or just
# define it here for convenience.
#
# Note: if you plan to use the reload feature, this file (upsmon.conf)
# must be readable by this user!  Since it contains passwords, DO NOT
# make it world-readable.  Also, do not make it writable by the upsmon
# user, since it creates an opportunity for an attack by changing the
# SHUTDOWNCMD to something malicious.
#
# For best results, you should create a new normal user like "nutmon",
# and make it a member of a "nut" group or similar.  Then specify it
# here and grant read access to the upsmon.conf for that group.
#
# This user should not have write access to upsmon.conf.
#
# (Unprivileged) OS account to run as:
# RUN_AS_USER @RUN_AS_USER@

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MONITOR <system> <powervalue> <username> <password> ("primary"|"secondary")
#
# List systems you want to monitor.  Not all of these may supply power
# to the system running upsmon, but if you want to watch it, it has to
# be in this section.
#
# You must have at least one of these declared.
#
# <system> is a UPS identifier in the form <upsname>@<hostname>[:<port>]
# like ups@localhost, su700@mybox, etc.
#
# Examples:
#
#  - "su700@mybox" means a UPS called "su700" on a system called "mybox"
#
#  - "fenton@bigbox:5678" is a UPS called "fenton" on a system called
#    "bigbox" which runs upsd on port "5678".
#
# The UPS names like "su700" and "fenton" are set in your ups.conf
# in [brackets] which identify a section for a particular driver.
#
# If the ups.conf on host "doghouse" has a section called "snoopy", the
# identifier for it would be "snoopy@doghouse".
#
# <powervalue> is an integer - the number of power supplies that this UPS
# feeds on this system.  Most personal computers only have one power supply,
# so this value is normally set to 1, while most modern servers have at least
# two.  You need a pretty big or special box to have any other value here.
#
# You can also set this to 0 for a system that doesn't take any power
# from the MONITORed supply, which you still want to monitor (e.g. for an
# administrative workstation fed from a different circuit than the datacenter
# servers it monitors). Use <powervalue> if 0 when you want to hear about
# changes for a given UPS without shutting down when it goes critical.
#
# <username> and <password> must match an entry in that system's
# upsd.users.  If your NUT username is "monuser" and your password is
# "blah", the upsd.users would look like this:
#
#	[monuser]
#		password  = blah
#		upsmon primary 	# (or secondary)
#
# "primary" means this system will shutdown last, allowing the secondary
# systems time to shutdown first.
#
# "secondary" means this system shuts down immediately when power goes
# critical and less than MINSUPPLIES power sources have reliable input feeds.
#
# The general assumption is that the "primary" system is the one with direct
# connection to an UPS (such as serial or USB cable), so the primary system
# runs the NUT driver and 'upsd' server locally and can manage the device,
# and it would often tell the UPS to completely power itself off as a step
# in power-race avoidance (see POWERDOWNFLAG for details).
#
# Also, since the primary system stays up the longest, it suffers higher risks
# of ungraceful shutdown if the estimation of remaining runtime (or of the
# time it takes to shut down this system) was guessed wrong. By consequence,
# the "secondary" systems typically monitor the power environment state
# through the 'upsd' processes running on the remote (often "primary") systems
# and do not directly interact with an UPS (no local NUT drivers are running
# on the secondary systems). As such, secondaries typically shut down as
# soon as there is a sufficiently long power outage, or a low-battery alert
# from the UPS, or a loss of connection to the primary while the power was
# last known to be missing.
#
# This assumption and configuration can also make sense for networked UPSes,
# where a rack full of servers might overload the communications capacity
# of the networked management card on the UPS - in this case you might either
# reduce the 'snmp-ups' or 'netxml-ups' driver polling rate, or dedicate a
# "primary" server and set up the rest as "secondary" systems.
#
# In case of such large setups as mentioned above, beware also that shutdown
# times of the rack done all at once can substantially differ from smaller
# scale experiments with single-server shutdowns, since systems can compete
# for shared storage and other limited resources as they go down (and also
# not everyone may safely shut down simultaneously - e.g. a NAS or DB server
# would better go down after all its clients). You would be well served by
# higher-end UPSes with manageable thresholds to declare a critical state.
#
# Examples:
#
# MONITOR myups@bigserver 1 upswired blah primary
# MONITOR su700@server.example.com 1 monuser secretpass secondary
# MONITOR myups@localhost 1 monuser pass primary	# (or secondary)

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MINSUPPLIES <num>
#
# Give the number of power supplies that must be receiving power to keep
# this system running.  Most systems have one power supply, so you would
# put "1" in this field.
#
# Large/expensive server type systems usually have more, and can run with
# a few missing.  Some of these can run with 2 out of 4, for example,
# so you'd set that to 2.  The idea is to keep the box running as long
# as possible, right?
#
# Obviously you have to put the redundant supplies on different UPS circuits
# for this to make sense!  See big-servers.txt in the docs subdirectory
# for more information and ideas on how to use this feature.

MINSUPPLIES 1

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SHUTDOWNCMD "<command>"
#
# upsmon runs this command when the system needs to be brought down.
#
# This should work just about everywhere ... if it doesn't, well, change it,
# perhaps to a more complicated custom script.
#
# Note that while you experiment with the initial setup and want to test how
# your configuration reacts to power state changes and ultimately when power
# is reported to go critical, but do not want your system to actually turn
# off, consider setting the SHUTDOWNCMD temporarily to do something benign -
# such as posting a message with 'logger' or 'wall' or 'mailx'. Do be careful
# to plug the UPS back into the wall in a timely fashion.
#
# For Windows setup use something like:
# SHUTDOWNCMD "C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\shutdown.exe -s -t 0"
# If you have command line using space character you have to add double quote to them, like this:
# SHUTDOWNCMD "\"C:\\Program Files\\some command.bat\" -first_arg -second_arg"
# Or use the old DOS 8.3 file name, like this:
# SHUTDOWNCMD "C:\\PROGRA~1\\SOMECO~1.bat -first_arg -second_arg"

SHUTDOWNCMD "/sbin/shutdown -h +0"

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SHUTDOWNEXIT <boolean|num>
#
# After initiating shutdown, should this upsmon daemon itself exit?
# By doing so NUT secondary systems can tell the NUT primary that
# it can proceed with its own shutdown and eventually tell the UPS
# to cut power for the load. ("Yes" by default)
#
# Some "secondary" systems with workloads that take considerable time
# to stop (e.g. virtual machines or large databases) can benefit from
# reporting (by virtue of logging off the data server) that they are
# ready for the "primary" system to begin its own shutdown and eventually
# to tell the UPS to cut the power - not as soon as they have triggered
# their own shutdown, but at a later point (e.g. when the upsmon service
# is stopped AFTER the heavier workloads).
#
# Note that the actual ability to complete such shutdown depends on the
# remaining battery run-time at the moment when UPS power state becomes
# considered critical and the shutdowns begin. You may also have to tune
# HOSTSYNC on the NUT primary to be long enough for those secondaries to
# stop their services. In practice, it may be worthwhile to investigate
# ways to trigger shutdowns earlier on these systems, e.g. by setting up
# `upssched` integration, or `dummy-ups` driver with overrides for stricter
# `battery.charge` or `battery.runtime` triggers than used by the rest of
# your servers.
#
# This option supports Boolean-style strings (yes/on/true or no/off/false)
# or numbers to define a delay (in seconds) between calling SHUTDOWNCMD
# and exiting the daemon. Zero means immediate exit (default), negative
# values mean never exiting on its own accord.
#
#SHUTDOWNEXIT yes

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NOTIFYCMD <command>
#
# upsmon calls this to send messages when things happen
#
# This command is called with the full text of the message (from NOTIFYMSG)
# as one argument.
#
# The environment string NOTIFYTYPE will contain the type string of
# whatever caused this event to happen.
#
# The environment string UPSNAME will contain the name of the system/device
# that generated the change.
#
# Note that this is only called for NOTIFY events that have EXEC set with
# NOTIFYFLAG.  See NOTIFYFLAG below for more details.
#
# Making this some sort of shell script might not be a bad idea.
# Alternately you can use the upssched program as your NOTIFYCMD for some
# more complex setups (e.g. to ease handling of notification storms).
# For more information and ideas, see docs/scheduling.txt
#
# Example:
# NOTIFYCMD @BINDIR@/notifyme

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# POLLFREQ <n>
#
# Polling frequency for normal activities, measured in seconds.
#
# Adjust this to keep upsmon from flooding your network, but don't make
# it too high or it may miss certain short-lived power events.

POLLFREQ 5

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# POLLFREQALERT <n>
#
# Polling frequency in seconds while UPS on battery.
#
# You can make this number lower than POLLFREQ, which will make updates
# faster when any UPS is running on battery.  This is a good way to tune
# network load if you have a lot of these things running.
#
# The default is 5 seconds for both this and POLLFREQ.

POLLFREQALERT 5

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# HOSTSYNC - How long upsmon will wait before giving up on another upsmon
#
# The primary upsmon process uses this number when waiting for secondary
# systems to disconnect once it has set the forced shutdown (FSD) flag.
# If they don't disconnect after this many seconds, it goes on without them.
#
# Similarly, upsmon secondary processes wait up to this interval for the
# primary upsmon to set FSD when an UPS they are monitoring goes critical -
# that is, on battery and low battery.  If the primary doesn't do its job,
# the secondaries will shut down anyway to avoid damage to the file systems.
#
# This "wait for FSD" is done to avoid races where the status changes
# to critical and back between polls by the primary.

HOSTSYNC 15

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DEADTIME - Interval to wait before declaring a stale ups "dead"
#
# upsmon requires a UPS to provide status information every few seconds
# (see POLLFREQ and POLLFREQALERT) to keep things updated.  If the status
# fetch fails, the UPS is marked stale.  If it stays stale for more than
# DEADTIME seconds, the UPS is marked dead.
#
# A dead UPS that was last known to be on battery is assumed to have gone
# to a low battery condition.  This may force a shutdown if it is providing
# a critical amount of power to your system.
#
# Note: DEADTIME should be a multiple of POLLFREQ and POLLFREQALERT.
# Otherwise you'll have "dead" UPSes simply because upsmon isn't polling
# them quickly enough.  Rule of thumb: take the larger of the two
# POLLFREQ values, and multiply by 3.

DEADTIME 15

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# POWERDOWNFLAG - Flag file for forcing UPS shutdown on the primary system
#
# upsmon will create a file with this name in primary mode when it's time
# to shut down the load.  You should check for this file's existence in
# your shutdown scripts and run 'upsdrvctl shutdown' if it exists, to tell
# the UPS(es) to power off.
#
# See the config-notes.txt file in the docs subdirectory for more information.
# Refer to the section:
# [[UPS_shutdown]] "Configuring automatic shutdowns for low battery events"
# or refer to the online version.
#
# For Windows setup use something like:
# POWERDOWNFLAG "C:\\killpower"
#
# For Unix/Linux systems the legacy common value is:
#   POWERDOWNFLAG /etc/killpower
# but nowadays you may want it in a temporary filesystem (e.g. under /run)
#
# WARNING: The 'upsmon' binary program does not have a built-in default,
# so this setting MUST be specified in the configuration, in order for the
# late shutdown integration to work on the particular primary-mode system!
POWERDOWNFLAG "@POWERDOWNFLAG@"

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NOTIFYMSG - change messages sent by upsmon when certain events occur
#
# You can change the default messages to something else if you like.

#
# If you use IGNORE, don't use any other flags on the same line.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OFFDURATION - put "OFF" state into effect if it persists for this many seconds
#
# NUT supports an "administrative OFF" for power devices which can be managed to
# turn off their application workload, while the UPS or ePDU remains accessible
# for monitoring and management. This toggle allows to delay propagation of such
# state into a known loss of a feed (possibly triggering FSD on `upsmon` clients
# which `MONITOR` the device and are in fact still alive -- e.g. with multiple
# power sources or because they as the load are not really turned off), because
# when some devices begin battery calibration, they report "OFF" for a few seconds
# and only then they might report "CAL" after switching all the power relays --
# thus causing false-positives for `upsmon` FSD trigger.
#
# A negative value means to disable decreasing the counter of working power
# supplies in such cases, and a zero makes the effect of detected "OFF" state
# immediate. Built-in default value is 30 (seconds).

OFFDURATION 30

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OBLBDURATION - put "OB LB" state into effect if it persists for this many
# seconds
#
# NUT normally raises alarms for immediate shutdown (FSD) for consumers of an
# UPS known to be on battery (OB) and achieving the low battery status (LB),
# if that is their last remaining power source to satisfy their MINSUPPLIES
# setting. In some special cases, users may want to delay raising the alarm
# (using the OBLBDURATION option) at their discretion and risk of an ungraceful
# shutdown.
#
# A non-positive value makes the FSD effect of detected "OB LB" state immediate.
# Built-in default value is 0 (seconds).
#
# NOTE: If both `OBLBDURATION` and `HOSTSYNC` options are set on the same
# (secondary) `upsmon` client system, and `HOSTSYNC` is shorter, it would be
# effectively ignored: `upsmon` would wait for up to `OBLBDURATION` seconds
# for the "OB LB" state to clear, and then the secondary client logic would
# fall through to immediate shutdown. If the primary system issues an FSD on
# this UPS, that would take an even higher-priority effect as soon as seen.
#
#OBLBDURATION 0

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# RBWARNTIME - replace battery warning time in seconds
#
# upsmon will normally warn you about a battery that needs to be replaced
# every 43200 seconds, which is 12 hours.  It does this by triggering a
# NOTIFY_REPLBATT which is then handled by the usual notify structure
# you've defined above.
#
# If this number is not to your liking, override it here.

RBWARNTIME 43200

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NOCOMMWARNTIME - no communications warning time in seconds
#
# upsmon will let you know through the usual notify system if it can't
# talk to any of the UPS entries that are defined in this file.  It will
# trigger a NOTIFY_NOCOMM by default every 300 seconds unless you
# change the interval with this directive.

NOCOMMWARNTIME 300

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# POLLFAIL_LOG_THROTTLE_MAX - device poll failure logging throttle
#
# upsmon normally reports polling failures for each device that are in place
# for each POLLFREQ loop (e.g. "Data stale" or "Driver not connected") to
# system log as configured.  If your devices are expected to be AWOL for an
# extended timeframe, you can use this throttle to reduce the stress on
# syslog traffic and storage, by posting these messages only once in every
# several loop cycles, and when the error condition has changed or cleared.
# A negative value means standard behavior (log on every loop, same as when
# max=1), and a zero value means to never repeat the message (log only on
# start and end/change of the failure state).
# Note that this throttle only applies to one latest-active error state per
# monitored device.
#
#POLLFAIL_LOG_THROTTLE_MAX 100

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# FINALDELAY - last sleep interval before shutting down the system
#
# On a primary, upsmon will wait this long after sending the NOTIFY_SHUTDOWN
# before executing your SHUTDOWNCMD.  If you need to do something in between
# those events, increase this number.  Remember, at this point your UPS is
# almost depleted, so don't make this too high.  If needed, on high-end UPS
# devices you can usually configure when the low-battery state is announced
# based on estimated remaining run-time or on charge level of the batteries.
#
# Alternatively, you can set this very low so you don't wait around when
# it's time to shut down.  Some UPSes don't give much warning for low
# battery and will require a value of 0 here for a safe shutdown.
#
# Note: If FINALDELAY on the secondary is greater than HOSTSYNC on the
# primary, the primary will give up waiting for that secondary system
# to disconnect.

FINALDELAY 5

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ALARMCRITICAL - an ALARM status can cause the UPS to become critical
# ALARMCRITICAL 1
#
# Some drivers implement handling device-/manufacturer-specific UPS alarms.
# Such alarms would generally be raised for severe UPS device conditions,
# but were also seen for mundane conditions such as an active HE/ECO mode.
#
# By default a device in an ALARM status is considered to be in a volatile
# state and e.g. loss of connection will result in the UPS being considered
# critical/dead, possibly resulting in shutdown depending on 'MINSUPPLIES'.
#
# If this behavior is unwanted (due to mundane device states raising ALARM
# and false shutdowns occurring as a side-effect), 'ALARMCRITICAL 0' can be
# set to disable this behavior and treat 'ALARM' as any regular UPS status.
#

# CERTVERIFY 1
#
# When compiled with SSL support, make upsmon verify all connections with

# Without this, there is no guarantee that the upsd is the right host.
# Enabling this greatly reduces the risk of man in the middle attacks.

# tuning, the `DEBUG_MIN` value *present* in *reloaded* configuration files
# is applied instantly and overrides any previously set value, from file
# or CLI options, regardless of older logging level being higher or lower
# than the newly found number; a missing (or commented away) value however
# does not change the previously active logging verbosity.

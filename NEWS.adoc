PLANNED: Release notes for NUT 2.8.4 - what's new since 2.8.3
-------------------------------------------------------------

https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/milestone/9

 - (expected) Dynamic Mapping Files (DMF) feature supported, to allow
   the driver binaries to be built once and data mappings to be loaded
   and modernized on the fly (porting from 42ITy project)

 - (expected) Porting of reference packaging from 42ITy project

 - (expected) Porting of patches suggested by different distribution packages

 - (expected) C code clean-up/consistency (string format security, work with
   Boolean values, string to number conversions, etc. in the same manner)

 - (expected) clean-up of libusb API variants support [#300 and follow-ups]

 - (expected) CI automation for coding style

 - (expected) CI automation for driver flags and variables to be certainly
   documented, handled in augeas lenses, nutconf classes, etc.

 - (expected) CI automation for use of data points in drivers that conform
   to patterns defined in link:docs/nut-names.txt[]

 - (expected) Bug fixes for fallout possible due to "fightwarn" effort in 2.8.0+


PLANNED: Release notes for NUT 2.8.3 - what's new since 2.8.2
-------------------------------------------------------------

https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/milestone/11

 - Fix fallout of development in NUT v2.8.0 and/or v2.8.1 and/or v2.8.2:
   * Move of `NUT_DEBUG_LEVEL` and "-D" CLI option handling to start of
     driver programs for issue #2259 in NUT v2.8.2 release misfired with
     regard to data-dump mode (it no longer caused foreground by default).
     [#2408]
   * The `nut-driver-enumerator.sh` improvements misfired in v2.8.2 release
     with an overlooked bit of shell syntax, and caused `nut-driver@upsname`
     instances to not auto-restart when `ups.conf` is edited. [#682, #2410]
   * Addition of "NUT Simulated devices" support to `nut-scanner` in v2.8.2
     broke detection of (in-)ability to find and query "Old NUT" servers via
     `libupsclient.so` (internal flag got always enabled). [#2246]
   * A fix for `upsmon` v2.8.1 setting of `OFFDURATION` [PR #2108, issue #2104,
     revisiting PR #2055, issue #2044] was overly zealous and impacted also
     the `OB` state in cases where communications to the data server were
     severed and `DEADTIME` setting was not honored. [PR #2462, issue #2454]
   * Using `drivername -c reload` (e.g. facilitated by `nut-driver-enumerator`
     script and service when editing `ups.conf`) led to disconnected Unix
     sockets and a tight polling loop that hogged CPU. While the underlying
     bug is ancient, it took recent development to hit it as a practical
     regression. [issue #1904, issue #2484]
   * Fallback `localtime_r()` and `gmtime_r()` for some platform builds where
     a `*_s()` variant was available was not handled correctly. [PR #2583]
   * A recently introduced `allow_killpower` did not actually work as an
     `ups.conf` flag (only as a protocol command). [issue #2605, PR #2606]
   * The ability of two copies of the driver program to talk to each other
     with `upsdrvquery.c` code was not complete for the case of indefinite
     `select()` wait timeout. Now `upsdrvquery_read_timeout()` fixed private
     use of `struct timeval={-1,-1}` as a trigger to `select(..., NULL)`,
     as logged in one part of code and not handled in the other, for the
     indefinite wait [#1922, #2392, #2686, #2670]

 - development iterations of NUT should now identify with not only the semantic
   version of a preceding release, but with git-derived information about the
   amount of iterations that followed (if available): the three-number "semver"
   would be seen on release snapshots, while other builds would expose the
   added components: one with the amount of commits on the main development
   trunk since the preceding release which are ancestors of the built code
   base, and in case of feature development branches -- another component
   with the amount of commits unique to this branch (which are not part of
   the development trunk). This allows to produce more relevant (monotonously
   growing) version identifiers for packages and similar artifacts, with more
   meaningful upgrades via development snapshots, eventually. A copy of the
   current version information would be embedded into "dist" archives as a
   `VERSION_DEFAULT` file. [#1949]

 - the `upsnotify()` common code introduced in recent NUT releases (integrating
   with service management frameworks, etc.) was a bit cryptic when it reported
   a *failure to notify* (e.g. when not running as a service currently), fixed
   now to report human-friendly text instead of internal enum codes. Follow-up
   to [issue #1590, PR #1777, PR #2136]

 - drivers, `upsd`, `upsmon`: reduce "scary noise" about failure to `fopen()`
   the PID file (which most of the time means that no previous instance of
   the daemon was running to potentially conflict with), especially useless
   since in recent NUT releases the verdicts from `sendsignal*()` methods
   are analyzed and lead to layman worded situation reports in these programs.
   [issue #1782, PR #2384]

 - drivers started with the `-FF` command-line option (e.g. wrapped into the
   systemd units to stay "foregrounded" *and* save a PID file anyway) should
   now also handle an existing PID file to interact with the earlier instance
   of the driver program, if still running (e.g. started manually). [#2384]

 - Extended instant commands for driver reloading with a `driver.exit`
   command for a protocol equivalent of sending a `SIGTERM`, e.g. when
   a newer instance of the driver program tries to start. [#1903, #2392]

 - A new `NUT_QUIET_INIT_BANNER` envvar (presence or "true" value) can now
   prevent the tool name and NUT version banner from being unilaterally
   printed out when NUT programs start. [issues #1789 vs. #316; #2573]

 - The `upsdrvctl` should now warn if executed on systems where NUT was
   built with support for service management frameworks like systemd or SMF,
   so nut-driver service units prepared by `nut-driver-enumerator` would
   conflict with manually-executed driver programs. This warning can be
   hushed by exporting a `NUT_QUIET_INIT_NDE_WARNING` environment variable
   with any value.

 - Extended `upsdrvctl` with a `list` operation (or `-l` option) to report
   manageable device configuration names (possible `<ups>` arguments to
   `start`, `stop` etc. operations), or to confirm a single name that it
   is known, and a `status` operation for more information. [#2567]

 - riello_ser updates:
   * added `localcalculation` option to compute `battery.runtime` and
     `battery.charge` if the device provides bogus values [issue #2390,
     following in the footsteps of #1692, #1685 done for `riello_usb`]
     (similar to `runtimecal` in some other drivers, may be refactored
     to that configuration and logic model in later NUT releases)

 - apcsmart updates:
   * Revised code to use `strncpy()` and avoid potential overflows that are
     possible with `strcpy()` used before. [PR #2564]
   * Lost communications led to a logging flood, should not anymore.
     In fact, the driver should try fully reconnecting upon getting into
     a prolonged data stale condition. [issue #704, PR #2564]

 - added Visench C1K (using serial port converter with USB ID `1a86:7523`)
   as known supported by `nutdrv_qx` (Megatec protocol) since at least
   NUT v2.7.4 release [#2395]

 - bicker_ser: added new driver for Bicker 12/24Vdc UPS via RS-232 serial
   communication protocol, which supports any UPS shipped with the PSZ-1053
   extension module. [PR #2448]

 - liebert-gxe: added new driver with support for Liebert GXE Series UPS
   (serial or USB posing as a serial port). [#2629]

 - nhs_ser: added new driver for numerous NHS Nobreaks, senoidal line -- UPS
   models with serial port, made by NHS Sistemas Eletronicos LTDA and popular
   in Brazil. Currently this driver only builds on Linux. [#2692]

 - `usbhid-ups` and `netxml-ups` updated to handle "No battery installed!"
   alarm also to set the `RB` (Replace Battery) value in `ups.status`.
   This may cause dual triggering of notifications (as an `ALARM` generally
   and as an important `REPLBATT` status in particular) in `upsmon`, but
   better safe than sorry. [#415]

 - usbhid-ups updates:
   * Support of the `onlinedischarge_log_throttle_hovercharge` in the NUT
     v2.8.2 release was found to be incomplete. [#2423, follow-up to #2215]
   * Added support for `interrupt_pipe_no_events_tolerance=N` setting to
     optionally prevent UPS lockup, indicated by continuous "Got 0 HID Objects"
     situation as a clue, by reconnecting on stale data.  Note that while some
     devices just report information upon subsequent poll and just have nothing
     urgent to declare with an USB interrupt, others (e.g. APC BXnnnnMI) were
     seen to lock up until a full connection restart. [#2671, #2681]
   * Added support for `lbrb_log_delay_sec=N` setting to delay propagation of
     `LB` or `LB+RB` state (buggy with APC BXnnnnMI devices circa 2023-2024).
     This may work better with flags like `onlinedischarge_calibration` and
     `lbrb_log_delay_without_calibrating` for some devices. [#2347]
   * General suggestion from `possibly_supported()` message method for devices
     with VendorID=`0x06da` (Phoenixtec), seen in some models supported by
     MGE HID or Liebert HID, updated to suggest trying `nutdrv_qx`. [#334]
   * MGE HID list of `mge_model_names[]` was extended for Eaton 9E, 5PX and 5SC
     series (largely guessing, feedback and PRs for adaptation to actual
     string values reported by devices via USB are welcome), so these devices
     would now report `battery.voltage` and `battery.voltage.nominal`. [#2380]
   * Added `ups.beeper.status` support for Masterpower MF-UPS650VA using the
     MGE HID subdriver. [#2662]
   * `powercom-hid` subdriver sent UPS shutdown commands in wrong byte order,
     at least for devices currently in the field. A toggle was added to set
     the old behavior (if some devices do need it), while a fix is applied
     by default: `powercom_sdcmd_byte_order_fallback`. [PR #2480]
   * `cps-hid` subdriver now supports more variables, as available on e.g.
     CP1350EPFCLCD model, including temperature. [PRs #2540, #2711]
   * USB parameters (per `usb_communication_subdriver_t`) are now set back to
     their default values during enumeration after probing each subdriver.
     Having an unrelated device connected with a VID:PID matching the
     `arduino-hid` subdriver prevented use of an actual `usb-hid` device due to
     changes made to this struct during probe. [#2611]

 - USB drivers could log `(nut_)libusb_get_string: Success` due to either
   reading an empty string or getting a success code `0` from libusb.
   This difference should now be better logged, and not into syslog. [#2399]

 - USB drivers can benefit from a new `nut_usb_get_string()` method which
   can do a fallback `en_US` query for devices which report a broken "langid"
   language identifier value. This notably manifested in inability to query
   device Manufacturer, Model and Serial Number values with some buggy device
   firmware or hardware. [PR #2604, issues #1925, #414]
   * Currently this was tested to fix certain device discovery with `usbhid-ups`;
     should also apply out of the box to same discovery logic in `blazer_usb`,
     `nutdrv_qx`, `riello_usb` and `tripplite_usb` drivers.
   * Also applied to `nut-scanner` and `libnutscan`. [issue #2615]
   * More work may be needed for other USB-capable drivers (`richcomm_usb`,
     `nutdrv_atcl_usb`) and for general code to collect string readings and
     other data points, and to configure the fallback locale or choose one
     if several are served by the device. [issues #2613, #2614, #2615]

 - USB drivers should now be more likely to succeed with iterative detection
   of an UPS interface on a composite USB device or when looking at devices
   with non-default interface/endpoint/config numbers. [PR #2611]

 - USB drivers should now accept a `LIBUSB_DEBUG=INTEGER` setting in `ups.conf`
   (as well as an environment variable that can be generally set via `nut.conf`
   or service unit methods or init script), to enable troubleshooting of LibUSB
   itself. [issue #2616]

 - USB drivers should now not log "insufficient permissions on everything" alone
   when some devices were accessible but just did not match -- clarify that case
   in the next line, when applicable. [PR #2699]

 - Introduced a new driver concept for interaction with OS-reported hardware
   monitoring readings. Currently instantiated as `hwmon_ina219` specifically
   made for Texas Instruments INA219 chip as exposed in the Linux "hwmon"
   subsystem of its "sysfs" interface (and talking I2C under the hood), this
   approach seems to have good potential to expand into covering more devices
   and perhaps platforms. [#2430]

 - Introduced `ECO` status concept for "ECO mode" (or "High Efficiency" mode,
   or "Energy Saver System"...) as named and defined by hardware vendors.
   One common aspect is that this is a balance of electrical efficiency vs.
   robust outage protection (which may be overkill for IT equipment whose
   PSU can survive several milliseconds on capacitors alone) which can be
   selected at run-time.  Previously such choice was made at the time of
   purchase, with the UPSes only supporting some one protection strategy.
   [issue #2495, PR #2637]
   * Updated documentation, end-user clients (CGI, NUT-Monitor UI);
   * Updated `upsmon` client with ability to report entering and exiting
     the ECO mode if reported by the driver;
   * Initial implementation for Eaton devices with `usbhid-ups` driver.

 - Introduced handling for the `ALARM` status, which already existed as a
   common denominator for devices seen with active `ups.alarm` variables.
   UPS devices in an `ALARM` status are generally considered volatile and
   may be considered critical/dead by the `upsmon` client earlier than in
   other statuses (e.g. in no-communication situations). It has to be noted
   that there is no common standard for what constitutes an alarm and such
   alarm states were also previously observed for less severe reasons. This
   depends on the manufacturer/device-specific implementation in the driver.
   [issues #415, #2657, PR #2658]
   * Updated documentation, end-user clients (CGI, NUT-Monitor UI);
   * Updated `upsmon` client with ability to report entering and exiting
     the ALARM status if reported by the driver;
   * Updated `upsmon` client with setting to toggle whether an `ALARM`
     status can prompt the UPS to become critical in certain situations.

 - upsmon:
   * it was realized that the `POWERDOWNFLAG` must be explicitly set in the
     configuration file, there is no built-in default in the binary program
     (the settings facilitated by the `configure` script during build "only"
     impact the `upsmon.conf.sample`, init-scripts and similar files generated
     from templates). [issue #321, PR #2383]
   * added an `OBLBDURATION` (seconds) setting to optionally delay raising
     the alarm for immediate shutdown in critical situation. [#321]
   * optimized `parse_status()` by not checking further strings if we had
     a match; report unexpected tokens in debug log. [#415]
   * revised internal `do_notify()` method to support formatting strings
     with two `%s` placeholders, to use if certain use-cases pass any extra
     information (e.g. not just "we have alarms" but their values too). [#415]
   * introduced handling for "unknown" `ups.status` tokens, reporting them
     as "OTHER" notification type (whenever the set of such tokens appears
     or changes) or "NOTOTHER" when they disappear. [#415]

 - More systemd integration:
   * Introduced a `nut-sleep.service` unit which stops `nut.target` when a
     system sleep was requested, and starts it when the sleep is finished.
     This helps avoid NUT shutting down a woken-up system just because its
     power state was critical before the sleep (called as a `SHUTDOWNCMD`
     implementation by the end-user), and a next-read timestamp was not seen
     (deemed to be a stale UPS, meaning lost communications during critical
     state, so must go down ASAP). While not as elegant as native systemd
     "inhibitor interface" support, this approach does work. [#1833, #1070]
   * Introduced support for the "inhibitor interface" as well (should be
     available on systems with systemd version 183 or newer) for a better
     handling of the time jump specifically in the `upsmon` client via new
     `Inhibit()` method in `common.c`. [#1070]
   * As an extension of the logic introduced above, hopefully now `upsmon`
     would behave better in face of any significant and unexpected clock
     jumps (on POSIX builds so far), even if they are not suspend/hibernate
     events (or they were but we could not have an inhibit lock). Now they
     should be handled similar (avoid stale UPS data and rash decisions)
     for summer/winter time change on non-UTC deployments, a debugger
     suspending the `upsmon` process, etc. [#2597]

 - gamatronic driver revised for safer memory operations; this was reported
   to have fixed a Segmentation Fault seen in earlier NUT releases with
   some of the devices supported by this driver. [#2427]

 - phoenixcontact_modbus driver: Introduced Phoenix Contact QUINT4-UPS/24DC
   management (only new modbus addresses). [#2689]

 - upsd:
   * `upsd_cleanup()` is now traced, to more easily see that the daemon is
     exiting (and/or start-up has aborted due to configuration or run-time
     issues). Warning about "world readable" files clarified. [#2417]

 - nut-scanner:
   * the tool relies on dynamic loading of shared objects (library files)
     orchestrated at run-time rather than pre-compiled, to avoid excessively
     huge package footprints. This however relies on knowing (or sufficiently
     safely guessing) the library file names to use, and short `libname.so`
     is not ubiquitously available. With the new `m4` macro `AX_REALPATH_LIB`
     we can store and try to use the file name which was present on the build
     system, while we search for a suitable library. [#2431]
+
NOTE: A different but functionally equivalent trick is done for `libupsclient`
during a NUT build.
   * fixed support for IPv6 addresses (passed in square brackets) for both
     `-s` start/`-e` end command-line options, and for `-m cidr/mask` option.
     [issue #2512, PR #2518]
   * newly added support to scan several IP addresses (single or ranges)
     with the same call, by repeating command-line options; also `-m auto{,4,6}`
     can be specified (once) to select IP (all, IPv4, IPv6) address ranges of
     configured local network interfaces.
     An `/ADDRLEN` suffix can be added to the option, to filter out discovered
     subnets with too many bits available for the host address part (avoiding
     millions of scans in the extreme cases).
     [issue #2244, issue #2511, PR #2509, PR #2513, PR #2517]
   * implemented parallel scanning for IPMI bus, otherwise default scan for
     all supported buses with `-m auto` takes unbearably long. [#2523]
   * bumped version of `libnutscan` to 2.6.0, it now includes a few more
     methods and symbols from `libcommon`. [issue #2244, PR #2509]
   * do not actively suggest `vendor(id)`, `product(id)`, and `serial` options
     for `bcmxcp_usb`, `richcomm_usb` and `nutdrv_atcl_usb` drivers for now
     [#1763, #1764, #1768, #2580]

 - all drivers should now support the optional `sdcommands` setting with
   a site-local list of instant commands to handle `upsdrv_shutdown()`,
   which may be useful in cases when the driver's built-in commands
   (or their order) do not meet the goals of particular NUT deployment.
   This can also help with shutdown endgame testing, using a mock command like
   starting the beeper (where supported) to verify that the UPS communications
   happen as expected, without compromising the load connected to the UPS.
+
Also defined `EF_EXIT_SUCCESS` and `EF_EXIT_FAILURE` in `include/common.h`
to avoid magic numbers in code like `set_exit_flag(-2)`, and revised whether
it is getting set at all in "killpower" vs. other cases, based on new
`handling_upsdrv_shutdown` internal flag.
+
NOTE: during this overhaul, many older drivers got their first ever supported
INSTCMD such as `shutdown.return`, `shutdown.stayoff` or `load.off`. Default
logic that was previously the content of `upsdrv_shutdown()` methods was often
relocated into new `shutdown.default` INSTCMD definitions. [#2670]

 - common code:
   * introduced a `NUT_DEBUG_SYSLOG` environment variable to tweak activation
     of syslog message emission (and related detachment of `stderr` when
     backgrounding), primarily useful for NIT and perhaps systemd. Most
     methods relied on logging bits being set, so this change aims to be
     minimally invasive to impact setting of those bits (or not) in the
     first place. [#2394]
   * `root`-owned daemons now use not the hard-coded `PIDPATH` value set
     by the `configure` script during build, but can override it with a
     `NUT_PIDPATH` environment variable in certain use-cases (such as
     tests). [#2407]
   * introduced a check for daemons working with PID files to double-check
     that if they can resolve the program name of a running process with
     this identifier, that such name matches the current program (avoid
     failures to start NUT daemons if PID files are on persistent storage,
     and some unrelated program got that PID after a reboot).  This might
     introduce regressions for heavily customized NUT builds (e.g. those
     embedded in NAS or similar devices) where binary file names differ
     significantly from a `progname` string defined in the respective NUT
     source file, so a boolean `NUT_IGNORE_CHECKPROCNAME` environment
     variable support was added to optionally disable this verification.
     Also the NUT daemons should request to double-check against their
     run-time process name (if it can be detected). [issue #2463]
   * introduced `m4` macros to check during `configure` phase for the
     platform, and a `nut_bool.h` header with `nut_bool_t` type to use
     during build, to avoid the numerous definitions of Boolean types
     and values (or macros) in the NUT codebase. [issue #1176, issue #31]
   * custom `distcheck-something` targets did not inherit `DISTCHECK_FLAGS`
     properly. [#2541]
   * added `status_get()` in NUT driver state API, to check if a status
     token string had been set recently, and to avoid duplicate settings.
     [PR #2565]
   * local socket/pipe protocol introduced a `LOGOUT` command for cleaner
     disconnection handling. [#2572]
   * codebase adapted to the liking of `clang-18` and newer revisions of
     `gcc-13`+ whose static analyzers on NUT CI farm complained about some
     imperfections after adding newer OS revisions to the population of
     build agents. [#2585, #2588]

 - updated `docs/nut-names.txt` with items defined by 42ITy NUT fork. [#2339]

 - various recipe, documentation and source files were revised to address
   respective warnings issued by the new generations of analysis tools.
   [#823, #2437, link:https://github.com/networkupstools/nut-website/issues/52[nut-website issue #52]]

 - fixed `configure` script to use default (target-specific) values of
   `CFLAGS`, `LIBS` etc. when probing relevant settings for each third-party
   dependency; as a consequence, on systems that support building for many
   targets, we check relevant build-ability for that target and not for the
   building system itself. [issue #2673, PR #2675]

 - fixed dynamic linking of Mozilla NSS on systems like Solaris/illumos,
   where the shared objects are not packaged into the common RPATH.
   [issue #2674, PR #2675]

 - added `scripts/valgrind` with a helper script and suppression file to
   ignore common third-party problems. [#2511]

 - when drivers dump collected data (during troubleshooting), flush `stdout`
   buffer immediately for sane logging (especially on Windows). [PR #2699]

 - revised `nut.exe` (the NUT for Windows wrapper for all-in-one service)
   to be more helpful with command-line use (report that it failed to start
   as a service, have a help message, pass debug verbosity to launched NUT
   programs...) and add a man page for it. [issue #2432, PR #2446]

 - the `PyNUTClient` module should no longer rely on presence of a `telnetlib`
   module in the build or execution environment (deprecated in Python 3.11,
   removed since Python 3.13). [#2183]

 - enabled installation of built single-file PDF and HTML (including man page
   renditions) under the configured `docdir`. It seems previously they were
   only built (if requested) but not installed via `make`, unlike the common
   man pages which are delivered automatically. [#2445]
+
   NOTE: The `html-chunked` documents are currently still not installed.

 - added support to `./configure --with-doc=man=dist-auto` to use distributed
   manual page files if present; only fall back to build them if we can. [#2473]

 - added a `make distcheck-light-man` recipe to require verification that the
   manual page files can be built using the prepared "tarball" archive. [#2473]

 - revised the documentation building recipes, with the goal to avoid building
   the `ChangeLog` products and their intermediate files more than once (but
   still react to `git` metadata changes during development), and to sanity
   check the resulting final document (currently only for `html-single` mode).
   As part of this, the `CHANGELOG_REQUIRE_GROUP_BY_DATE_AUTHOR` setting was
   added (for `make` calls and used by `tools/gitlog2changelog.py.in` script),
   and it defaults to `true` allowing for better ordered documents at the cost
   of some memory during document generation. [#2510]

 - lines in first section of NUT configuration report (can optionally remain as
   `config.nut_report_feature.log` and be installed into shared documentation
   of a NUT package) are now better grouped as miscellaneous features and
   detection results, then drivers and programs/tools. [#2676]

 - added a `common/Makefile.am` build product for a new internal library
   `libcommonstr.la` which allows a smaller selection of helper methods
   for tools like `nut-scanner` which do not need the full `libcommon.la`
   nor `libcommonclient.la`. [#2478, #2491]

 - added a `drivers/Makefile.am` build product for a new internal library
   `libserial-nutscan.la` to simplify `tools/nut-scanner/Makefile.am` recipes.
   [#2490]

 - build of `snmp-ups` and `netxml-ups` drivers now explicitly brings linker
   dependency on chosen SSL libraries. [#2479]

 - introduced `configure --with-modbus+usb` option to require an USB-capable
   libmodbus, and defaulted a couple of specific situations as if this was
   required (implicitly): `configure --with-modbus --with-usb` and
   either `--with-drivers=*apc_modbus*` (actually implies `--with-modbus`)
   or `--with-modbus-includes=... --with-modbus-libs=...`
   as a way to avoid surprises with custom NUT builds aiming to have an
   USB-capable `apc_modbus` driver (currently this requires a custom-built
   libmodbus). Also fixed (re-)detection of libmodbus RTU USB support with
   static libmodbus builds. [#2666]

 - brought keyword dictionaries of `nutconf` and `augeas` NUT configuration
   file parsers up to date; restored automated checks for `augeas` lenses.
   [issue #657, issue #2294]
+
   NOTE: Some known issues remain with augeas lens definitions so currently
   they should be able to parse common simple use-cases but not certain types
   of more complex configurations (e.g. some line patterns that involve too
   many double-quote characters) which are valid for NUT proper. [#657]

 - Cross-builds using only a host implementation of `pkg-config` program
   should now ignore host `*.pc` files and avoid confusion.

 - NUT CI farm build recipes, documentation and some `m4`/`configure.ac`
   sources updated to handle a much larger build scope on MacOS. Also
   migrated the builders to Apple Silicon from x86 (deprecated by CircleCI).
   [#2502]

 - Introduced a simple experiment to expose NUT client readings as filesystem
   objects via FUSE, in `scripts/fuse/execfuse-nut` now. [#2591]


Release notes for NUT 2.8.2 - what's new since 2.8.1
----------------------------------------------------

https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/milestone/10

 - Fix fallout of development in NUT v2.8.0 and/or v2.8.1:
   * dstate machinery: a segmentation fault (null pointer dereference) was
     possible with `INSTCMD` processing of commands without parameters nor
     `TRACKING` identifier. [#2155]
   * USB bus number detection for libusb-1.0 builds was overly zealous and
     wrongly considered zero values as an error. [#2198]
   * `upsmon` recognition of `CAL` state could linger after the calibration
     activity was completed by the hardware, which led to mis-processing of
     shutdown triggers. Also, notification was added to report "finished
     calibration". [issue #2168, PR #2169]
   * `upsmon` recognition of `OFF` state as a trigger for FSD (forced shut
     down) criticality considered also the input line state, which may be
     an independently evolving circumstance. [issue #2278, PR #2279]
   * `upsmon` support for `POLLFAIL_LOG_THROTTLE_MAX` did not neuter the
     applied setting when live-reloading configuration, so commenting it
     away in `upsmon.conf` did not have the effect of resetting the logging
     frequency to default. It also did not reset the counters to certainly
     follow the new configuration for existing faults. [issue #2207, PR #2209]
   * `upsmon` support for `POLLFAIL_LOG_THROTTLE_MAX` had an off-by-one error
     (e.g. reporting "Data stale" or "Driver not connected" every 30 sec with
     `POLLFAIL_LOG_THROTTLE_MAX 5` and `POLLFREQ 5` settings). [#2207]
   * Drivers running with non-default user account (e.g. with `user=root`
     in their configuration) failed to apply group ownership and permissions
     to their Unix socket file for interaction with the local data server.
     [#2185, #2096]
   * Dispatcher script `scripts/python/app/NUT-Monitor` referenced `py3qt3`
     instead of the correct `py3qt5`. It also tries to check both `py2gtk2`
     and `py3qt5` implementations verbosely, even if one is not installed.
     [#2199, #2201]
   * Set the `DesktopFileName` in `scripts/python/app/NUT-Monitor-py3qt5`,
     this binds the application with the desktop file and allow the Open
     Desktop compatible implementation to display the proper icon and
     application name. [#2205]
   * Original recipe for `apc_modbus` strictly required USB support even if
     building NUT without it. [#2262]
   * Builds requested with a specific C/C++ language standard revision via
     `CFLAGS` and `CXXFLAGS` should again be honoured. [PR #2306]
   * Allow requesting detailed debug builds (with disabled optimizations for
     binaries to best match the source code) for supported compilers using
     `configure` script option `--with-debuginfo`. Note that default autoconf
     behavior usually embeds moderate optimizations and debug information on
     its own. [PR #2310]
   * A fix applied among clean-ups between NUT v2.7.4 and v2.8.0 releases
     backfired for `usbhid-ups` subdriver `belkin-hid` which in practice
     relied on the broken older behavior; more details in its entry below.
     [PR #2371]

 - nut-usbinfo.pl, nut-scanner and libnutscan:
   * Library API version for `libnutscan` was bumped from 2.2.0 to 2.5.0
     during evolution of this NUT release.
   * USB VendorID:ProductID support list files generated by the script for
     different OS frameworks now include a comment with other possibly
     compatible driver names, where the respective file format allows for
     comments.
   * Added the concept of `alt_driver_names` in `nutscan_device_t` structure
     for ability to suggest a comment with other possibly compatible driver
     names in configuration snippets generated by `nut-scanner`; practical
     support implemented for USB connected drivers.
   * Added the concept of commented-away suggested option values `comment_tag`
     and a method to `nutscan_add_commented_option_to_device()`, instead of
     hacks in prepared config data which broke some use-cases. [#2221]
   * Command-line option `-U` for USB scan can now be specified several times
     to increase the detail level about hardware link to the device (this was
     previously always suggested, but may be not reliable if USB enumeration
     gets changed over time). [#2221]
   * Added generation of FreeBSD/pfSense quirks for USB devices supported
     by NUT (may get installed to `$datadir` e.g. `/usr/local/share/nut`
     and need to be pasted into your `/boot/loader.conf.local`). [#2159]
   * nut-scanner now avoids creating ambiguous `nutdevN` device section names
     when called separately to scan different media buses (one at a time).
     Now the "bus" name would be embedded (e.g. non-colliding `nutdev-usb1`
     and `nutdev-snmp1`). [#2247]
   * nut-scanner can now discover NUT simulated devices (`.dev` and `.seq`
     files) located in your sysconfig directory, and prepare configuration
     sections with the simulation driver (currently `dummy-ups`). [#2246]
   * nut-scanner now reports `dummy-ups` as driver when scanning NUT "bus"
     with Old or Avahi method. [#2236, #2245]

 - upsd: Fixed conditions for "no listening interface available" diagnosis
   to check how many listeners we succeeded with, not whether the first one
   succeeded or not. If not all requested (non-localhost) listeners were
   available, default to fail the daemon start-up attempt; support for an
   `ALLOW_NOT_ALL_LISTENERS` setting was added to control this behavior. [#723]

 - NUT CI improvements:
   * Added publishing recipes for PyNUT client bindings for NUT, so it ends
     up in the link:https://pypi.org/project/PyNUTClient[PyPI repository].
     [#2158]
   * Added support for new `ccache` namespace concept, where possible. [#2256]
   * Fixed an issue for builds configured `--without-usb`. [#2263]
   * Added a fallback for `libgd` discovery (for CGI etc. builds). [#2287]
   * Made `aspell` TeX module detection more reliable. [#2206]
   * Fixed recipes for completely out-of-tree builds to pass with documentation
     generation and checking on all tested "make" implementations. [#2318]
   * Various other recipe and documentation clean-up efforts. [#2284, #2269,
     #2261]

 - main driver core codebase:
   * Help users of drivers that can be built to support optionally USB and
     other media (like `nutdrv_qx` built for serial-only support), and built
     in fact without USB support but used for USB devices, with some more
     information to make troubleshooting easier. [issue #2259, PR #2260]
   * Driver programs with debug tracing support via `-D` CLI option and/or
     the `NUT_DEBUG_LEVEL` environment variable now check those earlier in
     their life-time, so that initialization routine can be debugged. [#2259]
   * Multiple USB-capable drivers got options to customize `usb_config_index`
     `usb_hid_rep_index`, `usb_hid_desc_index`, `usb_hid_ep_in` and
     `usb_hid_ep_out` hardware connection settings via `ups.conf` options.
     This is treated as experimental, not all code paths may be actually
     using such values from `struct usb_communication_subdriver_t` rather
     than hard-coded defaults. Discovery of correct values is up to the
     user at the moment (using `lsusb`, internet search, luck...) [#2149]

 - nut-driver-enumerator (NDE) service/script:
   * The optional daemon mode (primarily useful for systems which monitor
     a large and dynamic population of power devices) was enhanced with a
     `--daemon-after` variant which parses the configuration once before
     daemonization and this has a chance to fail while not forked off, as
     well as to allow only completing the service unit initialization when
     everything is actually ready to work (so further dependencies can start
     at the proper time). [#682]
   * Also applied other optimizations to the script implementation. [#682]

 - powerpanel text driver now handles status responses in any format and should
   support most devices. [#2156]

 - tripplite_usb driver now allows any device to match if a particular Unit ID
   was not specified in `ups.conf`. [PR #2297, issues #2282 and #2258]

 - snmp-ups driver:
   * added support for Eaton EMP002 sensor for ATS16 NM2 sub-driver. [#2286]
   * mapping table updates for apc-mib sub-driver. [#2264]

 - usbhid-ups driver:
   * `arduino-hid` subdriver was enhanced from "initial bare bones" experimental
     set of mapped data points to support some 20 more mappings to make it more
     useful as an UPS driver, not just a controller developer sandbox. [#2188]
   * `cps-hid` subdriver now supports devices branded as Cyber Energy and built
     by cooperation with Cyber Power Systems. [#2312]
   * `belkin-hid` subdriver now supports Liebert PSI5 devices which have a
     different numeric reading scale than earlier handled models. [issue #2271,
     PR #2272, PR #2369] Generally the wrong-scale processing was addressed,
     including a regression in NUT v2.8.0 which led to zero values
     in voltage data points which NUT v2.7.4 reported well [#2371]
   * The `onlinedischarge` configuration flag name was too ambiguous and got
     deprecated (will be supported but no longer promoted by documentation),
     introducing `onlinedischarge_onbattery` as the meaningful alias. [#2213]
   * Logged notifications about `OL+DISCHRG` state should now be throttled
     (see the driver manual page for more details) [#2214, #2215]:
     - If `battery.charge` is available, make the message when entering the
       state and then only if the charge differs from that when we posted
       the earlier message (e.g. really discharging) and is under
       `onlinedischarge_log_throttle_hovercharge` value (defaults to 100%);
     - Also can throttle to a time frequency configurable by a new option
       `onlinedischarge_log_throttle_sec`, by default 30 sec if `battery.charge`
       is not reported by the device (should be frequent by default, in case
       the UPS-reported state combination does reflect a bad power condition).

 - nutdrv_qx driver:
   * Fixed handling of `battery_voltage_reports_one_pack` configuration flag
     introduced in NUT v2.8.1. [originally by PR #1279; fixed by PR #2324,
     issue #2325]

 - Various code and documentation fixes for NSS crypto support. [#2274, #2268]

 - Laid foundations for the SmartNUT effort (aiming to integrate drivers with
   some other backends than the networked NUT data server process).

 - Eaton contributed recipes and scripts used to create the IPP for Unix
   bundle (aka Eaton IPSS Unix or UPP), a freely available value-added
   packaging of NUT distributed as the UPS software companion for OSes
   where their more complex UPS monitoring/management tools had not been
   ported. This allows for delivery of NUT packages with an interactive
   installer and some system integration scripts (events, notifications,
   status, shutdown daemon...), and was contributed to the NUT upstream
   project by Eaton -- provided "as is" at the moment, and may later serve
   as foundation or inspiration for new NUT features. [#2288]

 - nutconf (C++ library and tool to read and manage NUT configuration files)
   was started in the open by Eaton employees and used in the IPP installer,
   but the code lingered in a side branch. It was now brushed up to our common
   best practices and added to the main codebase. As of this import, there are
   known deficiencies in Windows platform support, as well as some un-awareness
   about configuration key words which appeared in NUT since 2013. [#2290]

 - The `tools/gitlog2changelog.py.in` script was revised, in particular to
   convert section titles (with contributor names coming from Git metadata)
   into plain ASCII character set, for `dblatex` versions which do not allow
   diacritics and other kinds of non-trivial characters in sections. This can
   cause successful builds of `ChangeLog.pdf` file on more platforms, but at
   expense of a semi-cosmetic difference in those names. [PR #2360, PR #2366]

Release notes for NUT 2.8.1 - what's new since 2.8.0
----------------------------------------------------

https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/milestone/8

 - "UPS management protocol", Informational RFC 9271 published
   by IETF at https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9271 and the
   IANA port number registry was updated accordingly at
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml?search=3493
   (even though this RFC is not formally an Internet Standard)

 - NUT documentation files were rearranged, renaming some to `*.adoc` pattern
   to facilitate automatic rendering in GitHub and IDE GUIs, and adding recipe
   support for GitHub issue/PR links. This `NEWS` file is now proper asciidoc
   rendered into `release-notes.pdf` (and HTML versions). [issue #1953, PR #2048]
   Internally, the documents would use a new way to define cross-linking to
   other pages and their chapters, to facilitate different renderers (including
   GitHub UI), and file names created for "chunked HTML" documentation format
   will no longer have the "chapter number, section number" format which is
   not easy to maintain over time with independent builds of documentation
   in NUT and the actual and historic snapshots for nut-website for example.
   Chapter/Section names will be adapted to produce "chunked HTML" file names
   instead. Documentation links rendered in GitHub UI should point to the HTML
   pages served by a current iteration of the NUT website. [PR #226, PR #669]

 - A new `configure --enable-spellcheck` toggle should add spelling checks
   to `make check` (by default, if tools are available) to facilitate quicker
   acceptance of contributions. [#2067]

 - Published a new maintainer GPG key to sign tags and release artifacts,
   and possibly git commits as well, as part of solution for issue #1410.
   You can pull it from common OpenPGP servers with the following command:

as part of https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1410 solution.

 - Bug fixes for fallout possible due to "fightwarn" effort and other
   evolution in NUT v2.8.0 release:
   * The `upsdebugx()` and similar methods were converted to macros in #685
     to avoid useless data manipulations and requests for logged information,
     whose results would be ignored instantly because the debug level is
     too low. As issue #1455 and PR #1495 found, in two cases the called
     commands did "meaningfully" modify data -- so without debug logs the
     program misbehaved. A known regression for `upscode2` driver; might
     be or not be a problem with `upsd` server in NUT v2.8.0 release,
     fixed for NUT v2.8.1.
   * A table in `cyberpower-mib` (for `snmp-ups` driver) sources was
     arranged in NUT v2.8.0 release in a way that precluded the driver
     logic from looking at all of its entries. Also a fix for instant
     command definitions had in fact broken them due to other development.
     Regressions fixed for NUT v2.8.1 [#1432, #2029]
   * A change for file-change detection in `dummy-ups` driver for NUT
     v2.8.0 release misfired on some platforms. Regression fixed for NUT
     v2.8.1 [#1420]
   * Fixed building of NUT man pages when just a few drivers are selected
     by `configure` script for custom builds [#1467]
   * Now that `upsdrvctl` can pass debugging level through to the launched
     driver(s), they would by default stay in the foreground. This can
     complicate (or simplify, when intentional) the management of service
     instances. Now there are explicit `upsdrvctl` options for choosing
     this (`-F`/`-B`), although default behavior is retained. Note that
     explicit foregrounding mode also keeps `upsdrvctl` tool from exiting
     and would not wait for one driver to complete initialization before
     starting another in case of mass-management loop to start all drivers
     (without specifying the single device) [#1759, #1806, #1875]
   * The `apcsmart` and `apcsmart-old` handled invalid data too zealously
     and aborted instead of skipping over it, like they did before [#2015]
   * A bit maths optimization in `riello_ser` and `riello_usb` misfired [#2137]
   * Something about compile-time macros or other warnings-related refactoring
     seems to have confused the MGE SHUT (Serial HID UPS Transfer) driver
     support [#2022]
   * Some warnings were not detected by the tools or build scenarios used
     earlier, and only got addressed now

 - An issue was identified which could cause `libupsclient` parser of device
   and host names to crash upon bad inputs (e.g. poorly resolved environment
   variables in scripts). Now it should fail more gracefully [#2052]

 - New `configure --enable-inplace-runtime` option should set default values
   for `--sysconfdir`, `--with-user` and `--with-group` options to match an
   existing NUT deployment -- for users who are trying if a custom build
   of recent codebase solves their practical issues. For "quick tests", a
   shortcut operation `./ci_build.sh inplace` was added [#1714]

 - State tree structure and methods (including "dstate" wrapper for common
   driver internals) was enhanced with time-stamping of last modification
   (setting, changing, deleting the value or some fields in an entry):
   this allows to detect stale information in a centralized fashion [#2010]

 - We lacked log information about changes of chroot jail (uncommon) and
   of UID/GID (everywhere), which makes troubleshooting harder (e.g. lack
   of access to config files or USB device nodes). Now we have it [#1694]

 - A `NUT_DEBUG_PID` envvar (presence) support was added to add current
   process ID to tags with debug-level identifiers. This may be useful
   when many NUT daemons write to the same console or log file. [#2118]

 - huawei-ups2000 is now known to support more devices, noted in docs and
   for auto-detection [#1448, #1684]

 - nutdrv_qx updates:
   * a `battery_voltage_reports_one_pack` driver option was added for devices
     which "natively" report a `battery.voltage` for a single battery pack or
     cell, not for the whole assembly [#1279]
   * the `voltronic_qs_protocol` should now accept both "V" (as before)
     and newly "H" dialects, which otherwise seem interchangeable [#1623]
   * the `armac` subdriver was enhanced to support devices with a different
     response pattern than previously expected per initial contribution.
     It was tested to work with Vultech V2000 and Armac PF1 series. [#1978]

 - nutdrv_qx and blazer updates:
   * extended default ranges for max battery voltage when guessing [#1279]

 - sms_ser, a driver for SMS Brazil UPS Protocol 1Phase, was introduced.
   NOTE: it may later become a subdriver under nutdrv_qx. [#2090]

 - usbhid-ups updates:
   * added support for `subdriver` configuration option, to select the
     USB HID subdriver for the device manually where automatic match
     does not suffice (e.g. new devices for which no `vendorid`/`productid`
     pair was built into any driver, or for different-capability devices
     with same interface chips, notably "phoenixtec/liebert" and "mge") [#1369]
   * cps-hid subdriver now applies same report descriptor fixing logic to
     devices with ProductID 0x0601 as done earlier for 0x0501, to get the
     correct output voltage data [#1497]
   * apc-hid subdriver now also supports ProductID 0x0004 [#1429]
   * ever-hid subdriver reported a `powerfactor` without a namespace (bug
     in 2.8.0 release), fixed to `outlet.powerfactor`
   * the `usbhid-ups` driver should now reconnect if `libusb` returned a
     memory allocation error [#1422] (seen as "Can't retrieve Report 0a:
     Resource temporarily unavailable"), which can cause practical problems
     in the field -- the driver otherwise interpreted the situation as
     `ups.status` being `OL OFF` and cut the power supply.
   * powercom-hid subdriver: fixed `UPS.Battery.ManufacturerDate` to map
     to `battery.mfr.date` (not `battery.date` which is the maintenance
     replacement date) [#1644]
   * added `onlinedischarge_calibration` option for UPSes that report
     `OL+DISCHRG` when they are in calibration mode [#2104]

 - riello_usb updates:
   * added `localcalculation` option to compute `battery.runtime` and
     `battery.charge` if the device provides bogus values [#1692, #1685]
     (similar to `runtimecal` in some other drivers, may be refactored
     to that configuration and logic model in later NUT releases)

 - powercom driver should now try harder to refresh data from device [#356]

 - tripplite_usb driver now supports configuration of `upsid` to match the
   specific device (not all firmware/hardware models support this) [#2075]

 - apcupsd-ups:
   * improvement for `POLL_INTERVAL_MIN` from PR #797 was buggy [#2007]
   * fix to clean obsoleted readings (if any) AFTER getting new info from an
     `apcupsd` daemon, to avoid the gap when NUT driver knows nothing [#2007]

 - apc_modbus driver was introduced, to cover the feature gap between existing
   NUT drivers for APC hardware and the actual USB-connected devices (or their
   firmwares) released since roughly 2010, which deprecated standard USB HID
   support in favor of Modbus-based protocol which is used across the board
   (also with their network management cards). The new driver can monitor APC
   UPS devices over TCP and Serial connections, as well as USB with a patched
   libmodbus (check https://github.com/EchterAgo/libmodbus/commits/rtu_usb
   for now, PR pending). [#139, #2063]
   * For a decade until this driver got introduced, people were advised to
     use apcupsd project as the actual program which talks to a device, and
     NUT apcupsd-ups driver to relay information back and forth. This was a
     limited solution due to lack of command and variable setting support,
     as well as relaying of just some readings (just whatever apcupsd exposes,
     further constrained by what our driver knows to re-translate), with
     little leverage for NUT to tap into everything the device has to offer.
     There were also issues on some systems due to packaging (e.g. marking
     NUT and apcupsd as competing implementations of the same features) which
     required clumsy workarounds to get both installed and running. Finally,
     there is a small matter of long-term viability of that approach: last
     commits to apcupsd sources were in 2017 (with last release 3.14.14 in
     May 2016): https://sourceforge.net/p/apcupsd/svn/HEAD/tree/

 - dummy-ups:
    * Added an `repeater_disable_strict_start` option to disable the driver
      exiting upon encountering any kind of error at startup (as repeater).
      This option should allow for collective `upsdrvctl` startup despite
      individual target UPS to be repeated or `upsd` not having come up yet.
      [#2132]
    * Revised detection of file path (for "dummy" mode) which misfired under
      some conditions, and unified several implementations. [#2118]

 - NUT for Windows:
   * Ability to build NUT for Windows, last tackled with a branch based on
     NUT v2.6.5 a decade ago, has been revived with the 2.8.x era codebase [#5].
     It is known that at this time some features are not complete, for more
     details see https://github.com/orgs/networkupstools/projects/2/views/1
   * Cross-builds of NUT for Windows using Linux and MinGW (and many custom
     built dependency packages, as documented in the
     link:scripts/Windows/README.adoc[scripts/Windows/README.adoc file])
     are now regularly tested on NUT CI farm with moderate integration via
     custom build script `scripts/Windows/build-mingw-nut.sh` [#1489]
   * Semi-native NUT for Windows builds with MSYS2/MinGW x64 environment are
     now regularly tested on AppVeyor, with the same `ci_build.sh` script and
     `Makefile` checks as used across the board for local developer builds,
     Linux/illumos/FreeBSD/OpenBSD/... on dedicated NUT CI farm on Fosshost,
     and MacOS on CircleCI [#1552]

 - snmp-ups updates:
   * Fixed detection for device agents which wrongly return the sysOID value
     as a string instead of an OID [#1710]
   * Clearer messages about skipping MIBs during driver initialization [#2037]
   * IETF MIB mapping updated for data points where negative readings
     are invalid [#1558]
   * Added SNMP subdriver "apc-epdu-mib" for APC easy PDU support [#1674]
   * Added SNMP subdriver "eaton-pdu-nlogic-mib" for nLogic (rebranded Eaton)
     support [#1698]
   * Added SNMP subdriver "hpe-pdu3-cis-mib" for HPE G2 Metered & Switched PDU
     initial "unitary" support (no daisychain support yet); also note that due
     to SNMP v1 implementation limitations on this device, you should prefer
     SNMP v3 to get both read and write rights [#1713]
   * Fixed processing loop for large SNMPv2/SNMPv3 responses where one item
     in the middle has a type error [#1682]
   * Better manage the slight nuances (especially in `ups.status`) between
     Eaton UPSs, and rename mibs from `pw` to `eaton_pw_nm2`, and from
     `pxgx_ups` to `eaton_pxg_ups` [#1715]
   * Fixed the long standing "Warning: excessive poll failures" issue, that
     was tied to non-existent OIDs, not well handled in some parts of the
     driver [#1716]
   * `baytech-mib.c` subdriver: fixed `baytech_outlet_status_info[]` set
     of valid outlet status values [#1871]
   * `cyberpower-mib.c` subdriver: support devices which report the shorter
     Vendor OID as their sysOID, e.g. "CyberPower PowerPanel Personal" [#1997]
     and support more data points including hardware status alarms [#1982]

 - The `bestfortress` driver shutdown handling was fixed to use a non-trivial
   default timeout [#1820]

 - The `optiups` driver only gave accurate voltage information with 120VAC
   models and assumed a 12V battery when calculating capacity. There is
   a protocol command that gives a (fixed) voltage which correlates with
   the voltage selection DIP switches on the back of the UPS, taking into
   account whether it is a 120 or 240VAC model. Likewise, now the battery
   capacity fix is applied globally, based on whether or not the battery
   voltage is greater than 20V. [#2089]

 - GPIO drivers [#1855]:
   * Added a new category of drivers, using GPIO interface to locally connected
     devices (currently limited to 2018+ Linux libgpiod, but its architecture
     was designed to support more OSes with their equivalents - PRs welcome)
   * `generic_gpio_libgpiod` driver using `libgpiod` backend was added
     (defaults to be required on Linux, optional on other platforms)

 - Added support for `make install` of PyNUT module and NUT-Monitor desktop
   application [#1462, #1504]

 - Regular CI coverage for NUT codebase enhanced with CircleCI running some
   scenarios on MacOS, might add Windows in the future. Fixed some build
   issues for MacOS that had crept into NUT v2.8.0 release [#1415, #1421]

 - NUT software-only drivers (dummy-ups, clone, clone-outlet) separated from
   serial drivers in respective Makefile and configure script options [#1446]

 - Fixed support for common USB matching options ("vendor", "device", "bus",
   etc.) for `riello_usb` and `richcomm_usb` [#1763] and updated man pages
   of all USB drivers using these options to include the same description
   [#1766]

 - Added a "busport" USB matching option (if supported by the hardware, OS and
   libusb on the particular deployment, it should allow to specify physical
   port numbers on an USB hub, rather than logical "device" enumeration values,
   and in turn -- this should be less volatile across reboots etc.) [#2043]

 - Added an `allow_duplicates` flag for common USB matching options which
   may help monitor several related no-name devices (although without knowing
   reliably which one is which... better than nothing) [#1756]

 - The `nut-scanner` program should now suggest same configuration fields as
   those used by common USB matching options in (most of the) drivers, e.g.
   adding "device" to the generated configuration section [#1790]

 - Stuck drivers that do not react to `SIGTERM` quickly are now retried with
   `SIGKILL` [#1424]

 - Each driver should now report its `driver.state` to help readers determine
   whether it is initializing, reconnecting, or running regular loops [#1767]

 - Code which resolves full paths to libraries should now consider the common
   environment variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` as a preferred possible override
   to built-in paths (note that most operating systems advise against setting
   this variable unless troubleshooting, although other systems rely on it)
   [#805]

 - Debug information tracing methods like `upsdebugx()` should now be less
   limited in the sizes of messages that they can print, such as path names
   that may be quite long. Note that the OS methods manipulating the strings,
   and receivers such as logging systems, may still impose limits of their own.

 - The `nut-scanner` usage and debug printouts now include the loadable library
   search paths, to help troubleshooting especially in multi-platform builds;
   pre-filtering of the built-in paths was introduced (to walk only existing
   and unique directory names) [#317]

 - The nut-scanner program was updated to fall back to loading unresolved
   library filenames, hoping that `lt_dlopen()` implementation on the current
   platform would find library files better [#805]

 - Detection of `libltdl` in `configure` script updated with fallback code to
   find it on systems that deliver the library to `/usr/local/lib` (e.g. on
   FreeBSD) [#1577]

 - An explicit `configure --with-nut-scanner` toggle was added, specifically
   so that build environments requesting `--with-all` but lack `libltdl` would
   abort and require either to install the dependency or explicitly forfeit
   the tool (some distro packages missed it quietly in the past) [#1560]

 - The `nut-scanner` program should now by default warn about serial numbers
   which do not make much sense (are duplicate, empty, all same character, etc)
   [#1810]

 - Existing openssl-1.1.0 support added for NUT v2.8.0 release was tested to
   be sufficient without deprecation warnings for builds against openssl-3.0.x
   (but no real-time testing was done yet) [#1547]

 - upslog: Added support for logging multiple devices with one call to the
   program [#1604]

 - Documentation to integrate NUT USB driver startup with `usb_resetter` script
   has been contributed to `scripts/usb_resetter` (the script itself is tracked
   externally on GitHub), along with a configuration example for Linux+systemd
   [#1887]

 - Some fixes applied to Solaris/illumos packaging and SMF service support
   [#1554, #1564]

 - Some fixes for builds on older OSes with less functional default system
   shell interpreters - now `autogen.sh` supports a `CONFIG_SHELL` envvar
   to inject its value into generated `configure` script [#1736]
   * Note that you may have to install additional tools (possibly from
     third-party FOSS packaging efforts) to prepare and build the NUT
     codebase, and/or prefer non-default system provided implementations
     (e.g. to use the XPG4 `grep` with `-E` support on Solaris as detailed
     in https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1736 comments)
   * Build environment configuration notes in link:docs/config-prereqs.txt[]
     file refreshed to cover building of current NUT codebase in CentOS 6
     [#1804] and Solaris 8 [#1736, #1738]

 - `configure` script, reference init-script and packaging templates updated
   to eradicate `@PIDPATH@/nut` ambiguity in favor of `@ALTPIDPATH@` for the
   unprivileged processes vs. `@PIDPATH@` for those running as root [#1719]

 - `configure` script enhanced: `--with-unmapped-data-points` option allows
   to build SNMP and USB-HID subdrivers with entries discovered by the scripts
   which generated them from data walks, but developers did not rename yet
   to NUT mappings conforming to link:docs/nut-names.txt[] standards [#1699]

 - PyNUT.py version bumped to 1.5.0 with some improvements:
   * `ListClients()` method fixed (was broken in many ways), and is now
     CI-tested [#549]
   * `DeviceLogin()` method added (mostly as aid to CI-test `ListClients()`
     in a practically relevant manner, so far)

 - nutclient C++ library:
   * added `listDeviceClients()` and `deviceGetClients(dev)` to `Client`
     classes, and `Device::getClients()` to match PyNUT capabilities [#549]
   * published artifacts may include a `libnutclientstub` which is an
     implementation of a NUT TCP client in C++ with in-memory data store.

 - upsclient C library:
   * added support for `NUT_QUIET_INIT_SSL` environment variable to hide
     the infamous "Init SSL without certificate database" warning [#1662]

 - The `upsd.conf` listing of `LISTEN` addresses was previously inverted
   (the last listed address was applied first), which was counter-intuitive
   and fixed for this release [#2012]

 - The `upsd` configured to listen on IPv6 addresses should handle only
   IPv6 (and not IPv4-mappings) to avoid surprises and insecurity; it
   will now warn if a host name resolves to several addresses (and will only
   listen on the first hit, as before in such cases) [#2012]

 - A definitive behavior for `LISTEN *` directives became specified, to try
   handling both IPv4 and IPv6 "any" address (subject to `upsd` CLI options
   to only choose one, and to OS abilities). When both address families are
   enabled, the `upsd` data server will first try to open an IPv6 socket
   asking for disabled IPv4-mapped IPv6 address support (if the OS honors
   that), and then an IPv4 socket (which may fail if the IPv6 socket already
   covers it anyway); in other words, you can end up with one or two separate
   listening sockets. [#2012]

 - sstate (server state, e.g. upsd) should now "PING" drivers also if they
   last reported themselves as "stale" (and might later crash) so their
   connections would be terminated if really no longer active [#1626]

 - Clarified documentation in codebase according to end-user feedback [#1721,
   #1750 and others over time]

 - upsmon client changes include:
   * Several fixes for `upsmon` behavior [#1761, #1680...], including new
     ability to configure default POWERDOWNFLAG location -- packagers are
     encouraged to pick optimal location for their distributions (which
     remains mounted at least read-only late in shutdown) and a new optional
     POLLFAIL_LOG_THROTTLE_MAX setting [#529, #506]
   * Also `upsmon` should now recognize `OFF` and `BYPASS` flags in `ups.status`
     and report that these states begin or end. The `OFF` state usually means
     than an administrative action happened to power off the load, but the UPS
     device is still alive and communicating (USB, SNMP, etc.); corresponding
     `MONITOR`'ed amount of power sources are considered not being "fed" for
     the power value calculation purposes. The `BYPASS` state is now treated
     similarly to `ONBATT`: currently this UPS "feeds" its load, but if later
     communications fail, it is considered dead. This may have unintended
     consequences for devices (or NUT drivers) that do not report these modes
     correctly (e.g. an APC calibration routine seems to start with a few
     seconds of "OFF" state), so the reported status is only considered as a
     loss of feed if it persists for more than `OFFDURATION` seconds. [#2044,
     #2104]
   * Introduced `SHUTDOWNEXIT no` configuration toggle for systems which
     require a long time to stop their workload such as virtual machines.
     Since the disconnection of a "secondary" client is treated by the
     "primary" system as permission to proceed with its own shutdown and
     power-off for the UPS, the original (now merely default) behavior to
     call `SHUTDOWNCMD` and immediately exit could be counter-productive.
     An optional delay can also be introduced. [#2133]
   * Note there were other changes detailed below which impacted several NUT
     programs, including `upsmon`.

 - Extended Linux systemd support with optional notifications about daemon
   state (READY, RELOADING, STOPPING) and watchdog keep-alive messages [#1590]
   * Normally *inability* to send such notifications (e.g. lack of systemd
     or similar framework on the particular platform) would be reported once
     per daemon uptime on its console log, to help troubleshooting situations
     where such lack of notifications can cause automated service restarts.
     These messages can be hidden by setting `NUT_QUIET_INIT_UPSNOTIFY=true`
     environment variable in init-scripts on platforms where such frameworks
     are not expected. [#2136]

 - Extended Linux systemd units with aliases named after the daemons:
   `nut-server.service` as `upsd.service`, and `nut-monitor.service` as
   `upsmon.service` (so simple `systemctl reload upsd` can work) [#1777]

 - Extended driver-server socket protocol with `BROADCAST (num)` keyword,
   and a `NOBROADCAST` as a shortcut for `BROADCAST 0`. This allows clients
   to toggle whether they want to receive `send_to_all()` updates from a
   driver, or only answers to requests they send [#1914]

 - Added support for `make sockdebug` for easier developer access to the tool;
   also if `configure --with-dev` is in effect, it would now be installed to
   the configured `libexec` location. A man page was also added. [#1936]

 - Numerous daemons (`upsd`, `upsmon`, drivers, `upsdrvctl`, `upssched`)
   which accepted `-D` option for debug setting previously, now can also
   honour a `NUT_DEBUG_LEVEL=NUM` environment variable if no `-D` arguments
   were provided. Unlike those arguments, the environment variable does
   not enforce that daemons run in foreground mode by default [#1915]
   * Note that unlike some other NUT daemons, `upssched` with enabled
     debug does not stop reporting on `stderr`! [#1965]

 - A bug in `upssched` was discovered and fixed, where it ran a tight loop
   stressing the CPU; it was presumably introduced between NUT v2.7.4 and
   v2.8.0 releases [#1964, #1965]

 - Implemented generic support for INSTCMD and SETVAR use-cases shared by
   all drivers, and in particular to see and change active debug verbosity
   using the driver-server and server-client protocol (at higher priority
   than CLI or config file choices) per [#1285], e.g.
------
# Set verbosity level 6:
:; upsrw -s driver.debug=6 UPS

# Set verbosity level 0 to disable the noise (even if debug_min is set):
:; upsrw -s driver.debug=0 UPS1@localhost

# Un-set the protocol override, honour CLI or config-file settings again:
:; upsrw -s driver.debug=-1 remoteUPS@1.2.3.4
------
+
and a `driver.killpower` instant command (for safety, must be unlocked by
   `driver.flag.allow_killpower` protocol setting or `allow_killpower`
   configuration flag), which is now the first choice for `driver -k`
   operations [#1917, #1923]

 - Implemented basic support for `ups.conf` reloading in NUT drivers,
   with a `driver.reload-with-error` instant command (more commands and
   signal handling may be available depending on platform), with a goal
   of changing inconsequential settings like `debug_min` for a running
   driver. This can also benefit the drivers on systems managed by real-time
   `nut-driver-enumerator` and for simpler changes the drivers get only
   reloaded and not redefined and restarted. Reload signals should also
   be reasonably supported with `upsdrvctl` tool. Relevant CLI options
   for `-c CMD` handing were added to drivers and `upsdrvctl`, although
   their availability may vary between operating systems [#1903, #1914, #1924]

 - Drivers should now accept `SIGURG` (or `SIGWINCH` on systems that lack
   the former) on POSIX platforms to dump their current state information
   and move on. Such report goes to `stdout` of the driver process (may
   be disconnected when background mode is used) -- this can help with
   troubleshooting [#1907]

 - Recipes and `main.c` code were enhanced to produce a `libdummy_mockdrv.la`
   helper library during build (not intended to be installed nor distributed),
   in order to facilitate creation of test programs which behave like a driver
   [#1855]

 - Further revision of public headers delivered by NUT was done, particularly
   to address lack of common data types (`size_t`, `ssize_t`, `uint16_t`,
   `time_t` etc.) in third-party client code that earlier sufficed to only
   include NUT headers. Sort of regression by NUT 2.8.0 (note those consumers
   still have to re-declare some numeric variable types used) [#1638, #1615]

 - The `COPYING` file was updated with licenses and attribution for certain
   source code files and blocks coming from the Internet originally [#1758]

 - The `tools/gitlog2changelog.py.in` script was revised, in particular to
   generate the `ChangeLog` file more consistently with different versions
   of Python interpreter, and without breaking the long file paths in the
   resulting mark-up text [#1945, #1955]

 - The "NUT client for VMware ESXi" project (by René Garcia) got its build
   recipes published on GitHub at https://github.com/rgc2000/NutClient-ESXi
   [#1961]


Release notes for NUT 2.8.0 - what's new since 2.7.4
----------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Earlier discussions (mailing list threads, GitHub issues, etc.) could
refer to this change set (too long in the making) as NUT 2.7.5.

 - New (optional) keywords for configuration files were added,
   so existing NUT 2.7.x builds would not accept them if some
   deployments switch versions back and forth -- due to this,
   semantically the version was bumped to NUT 2.8.x.

 - Add support for openssl-1.1.0 (Arjen de Korte)

 - libusb-1.0 API support in addition to libusb-0.1 API [#300]

 - Add support for `DISABLE_WEAK_SSL=true` in upsd.conf to disable older/weaker
   SSL/TLS protocols and ciphers: when NUT is built against relatively recent
   versions of OpenSSL or NSS it will be restricted to TLSv1.2 or better.
   For least-surprise, currently defaults to `false` and complains in log
   [PR #1043]

 - Add support for `ALLOW_NO_DEVICE=true` (as an upsd.conf flag or environment
   variable passed from caller of the program), to allow starting the data
   server initially without any device configurations and reloading it later
   to apply config changes on the fly [PR #766]

 - Add support for `debug_min=NUM` setting (ups.conf, upsd.conf, upsmon.conf)
   to specify the minimum debug verbosity for daemons. This allows "in-vivo"
   troubleshooting of service daemons without editing init scripts or service
   unit definitions.

 - Improve support for upsdrvctl for managing of numerous device configs,
   including default "maxretry=3" and a "nowait" option to complete the
   "start of everything" mode after triggering the drivers and not waiting
   for them to complete initializing. This matters on systems that monitor
   from dozens to hundreds of devices.

 - Drivers support a new value for `synchronous` setting, which is the
   new default now: `auto`.  Initially after driver start-up this mode
   acts as the older default `off`, but would fall back to `on` in case
   the driver fails to send reports to `upsd` by overflowing the socket
   buffer in async mode -- so the next connections of this driver uptime
   would be synchronized (potentially slower, but safer -- blocking on
   writes to the data server).  This adaptation would primarily impact
   and benefit devices with many (hundreds of) data points, such as
   ePDUs and daisy chains. [issue #1309, PR #1315]

 - Daemons such as upsd, upsmon, upslog, and device drivers previously
   implied that enabled debugging (or upslog to stdout) means foreground
   running, otherwise the daemon was always sent to the background.
   Now there are explicit options for this (`-F`/`-B`), although default
   behavior is retained. This change is used for simplified service unit
   definitions.

 - Improvements for device discovery or driver "lock-picking", including
   general support for:
   * "Standalone" mode (`-s` option), to monitor a device which is not
     detailed or mentioned in ups.conf
   * `NUT_ALTPIDPATH` and `NUT_STATEPATH` environment variables to override
     the paths built into the driver binary [PR #473 and #507]
   * "Driver data dump" mode (`-d` option), to poll a device for one or
     few ('update_count' ) loops, report discovered values (dump the data
     tree in upsc-like format), and exit. This complements the `nut-scanner`
     for finding and identifying devices.

 - support for new devices:
   * IBM 6000 VA LCD 4U Rack UPS; 5396-1Kx (USB)
   * Phoenix Contact QUINT-UPS model 2320461 (Modbus)
   * Tripp-Lite SU3000LCD2UHV (USB; protocol 1330)
   * Emerson Avocent PM3000 PDU (SNMP)
   * HPE ePDU (SNMP)

 - nutdrv_qx: enhanced estimation of remaining battery runtime based
   on speed of voltage drop, which varies as they age [PR #1027]

 - nutdrv_qx: several subdrivers added or improved, including:
   * "snr" subdriver with USB connection, for SNR-UPS-LID-XXXX [PR #1008].
     Note that end-users should reference explicitly the `snr` subdriver
     in their `ups.conf` settings because of USB chip using the same
     values of VendorID/ProductID as fabula_subdriver, fuji_subdriver,
     and krauler_subdriver.
   * "hunnox" subdriver, as a dialect of earlier "fabula" [PR #638]
     adds support for Hunnox HNX-850 with USB connection and reported to work
     for Powercool, Iron Guardian, ARES devices and possibly many others from
     discussions linking to the pull request which introduced the driver.
   * "phoenixtec" subdriver for Masterguard A and E series, device series
     A700/1000/2000/3000(-19) and E40/60/100(-19). [PR #975]
   * "ablerex" subdriver provided by the OEM vendor, note that it replaces
     "krauler_subdriver" as default handler for VID:PID 0xffff:0x0000
     [PR #1135]
   * Legrand HID defined and handled by "krauler_subdriver" by default
     [PR #1075, issue #616]
   * add new "armac" subdriver, tested with Armac R/2000I/PSW, but should
     support other UPSes that work with "PowerManagerII" software from
     Richcomm Technologies from around 2004-2005 [PR #1239, issue #1238]

 - microsol-apc (starting at version 0.68 as derived from solis 0.67):
   adding support for newer APC Back-UPS BR hardware, such as
   APC Back-UPS BZ1500, BZ2200BI and BZ2200I [PR #994]

 - pijuice: added new i2c bus driver for PiJuice HAT, a battery UPS module
   for the Raspberry Pi systems [PR #730]

 - huawei-ups2000: added new driver for USB (Linux 5.12+ so far) and Serial
   RS-232 Modbus device support of Huawei UPS2000/2000A (1kVA-3kVA) series,
   and possibly some related FSP UPS models. [PR #954]

 - socomec_jbus: added new driver for modbus-based JBUS protocol over serial
   RS-232 for Socomec UPS (tested with a DIGYS 3/3 15kVA model, working
   on Linux x86-64 and Raspberry Pi 3 ARM). [PR #1313]

 - adelsystem_cbi: added new driver for ADELSYSTEM CBI2801224A, an all-in-one
   12/24Vdc DC-UPS, which supports the modbus RTU communication protocol
   [PR #1282]

 - generic_modbus: added new driver for TCP and Serial Modbus device support.
   The driver has been tested against PULS UPS (model UB40.241) via
   MOXA ioLogikR1212 (RS485) and ioLogikE1212 (TCP/IP), and configuration
   allows to map custom registers and addresses to NUT events [PR #1052]

 - genericups: added support for FTTx battery backup devices, and new signal
   type mappings for the contact closure pins interpretation (RB for replace
   battery, BYPASS for disconnected battery, and "none" or NULL for signals
   to ignore) [PR #1061]

 - add devices to HCL/DDL:
   * APC Back-UPS CS (USB)
   * CPS CP1500EPFCLCD (USB)
   * CPS EC350G, EC750G (USB)
   * CPS PR2200LCDRT2U (SNMP)
   * Eaton ATS 16 and 30 (SNMP)
   * Eaton 5E2200VA (USB)
   * Eaton 9PX Split Phase 6/8/10 kVA (XML/USB/SHUT)
   * Eaton 9PX (XML/USB/SHUT)
   * Eaton Ellipse PRO 650 VA (USB)
   * Ippon Back Comfo Pro II 650/850/1050 (USB)
   * Numeric Digital 800 (USB)
   * Opti-UPS PS1500E (USB)
   * Powercool 350VA to 1600VA (USB)

 - C++11 support in nutclient library and cppunit tests

 - Added C++ testing mock for TcpClient class (nutclientmem/MemClientStub:
   data stored in local memory) [PR #1034]

 - Dual Python 2 and 3 compatibility in development scripts; ability to
   run build activities and resulting built NUT programs on systems that
   do not have a binary named "python" [PR #1115 and some before it]

 - Added Russian translation for NUT-Monitor GUI client [PR #806]

 - Separated NUT-Monitor UI into two applications, NUT-Monitor-py2gtk2 and
   NUT-Monitor-py3qt5, suitable for two generations of Python ecosystem
   with their great differences; `NUT-Monitor` name is retained for wrapper
   script which calls one of these, such that the current system can execute
   [PRs #1310, #1354]

 - Various USB driver families: expanded device-matching with "device" in
   addition to "bus" and generic USB fields. This is needed to support
   multiple attached devices that seem identical by other fields (e.g.
   same vendor, same model, same USB bus, and no serial number) [PR #974]

 - Various USB driver families: Improved HID parsing for byte-stream to
   number conversions on different CPU architectures [PR #1024]

 - Various USB HID driver families: added support for composite devices
   utilizing interface greater than 0 for the UPS interface [PR #1044]

 - usbhid-ups:
   * added generic framework for fixing Report Descriptors which can be
     used for different manufacturers by adding code to the appropriate
     subdriver rather than polluting the main code with UPS specific
     exceptions, and applied fixes for known mistakes in (some releases
     of firmware for) CyberPower CPS*EPFCLCD [issue #439, PR #1245]
   * added `onlinedischarge` option for UPSes that report `OL+DISCHRG`
     when wall power is lost [PR #811]
   * changed detection of VendorID 0x06da handling of which is claimed
     by Liebert/Phoenixtec HID historically, and MGE HID (for AEG PROTECT
     NAS UPSes) since NUT 2.7.4, so that the higher-priority MGE subdriver
     would not grab each and all of the devices exposing that ID [PR #1357]
   * CPS HID: add input.frequency and output.frequency

 - snmp-ups and nut-scanner should now support more SNMPv3 Auth and Priv
   protocols, as available at NUT build time [PRs #1165, #1172]

 - nut-scanner: various improvements, including:
   * detection of libraries at runtime
   * tracing information
   * limiting parallelism (thread count) [PRs #1158, #1164]

 - nut-ipmipsu: improve FreeIPMI support to build cleanly against older and
   newer FreeIPMI versions [PR #1179]

 - the powerpanel driver now also supports CyberPower OR1500LCDRTXL2U with

   unit support [PR #412]

 - tripplite: the "Tripp-Lite SmartUPS driver" as tested with SMART2200NET
   learned to discover the firmware generation and some device features,
   and in particular to manage power separately on one or two outlet groups
   [PR #1048]

 - tripplite_usb: updated to recognize the "3005" protocol [PR #584]

 - libnutclient: introduce getDevicesVariableValues() to improve performances
   when querying many devices (up to 15 times faster)

 - nut-driver-enumerator: introduced a script for Linux systemd and
   Solaris/illumos SMF to inspect current NUT configuration in ups.conf
   file and generate service management instances for each currently
   tracked power device. Also introduced services to monitor the NUT
   configuration and react to editions of this file, mostly intended
   for deployments that do massive monitoring of dynamically changing
   farms of power devices.

 - Fix File descriptors leaks by upsmon and upssched (SELinux errors)

 - systemd support improvements:
   * POWEROFF_WAIT
   * reload support for upsd
   * Deliver systemd-tmpfiles config to pre-create runtime locations
     [PR #1037 for Issue #1030]
   * Update units with SyslogIdentifier=%N for better logging [PR #1054]

 - upsrw: display the variable type beside ENUM / RANGE

 - Added `PROTVER` as alias to `NETVER` to report the protocol version in use.
   Note that NUT codebase itself does not use this value and handles commands
   and reported errors individually [issue #1347]

 - Implement status tracking for instant commands (instcmd) and variables
   settings (setvar): this allows to get the actual execution status from the
   driver, and is available in libraries and upscmd / upsrw [PR #659]

 - Add support for extra parameter for instant commands, both in library and
   in upscmd

 - dummy-ups can now specify `mode` as a driver argument, and separates the
   notion of `dummy-once` (new default for `*.dev` files that do not change)
   vs. `dummy-loop` (legacy default for `*.seq` and others) [issue #1385]

 - new protocol variables:
   * `input.phase.shift`
   * `outlet.N.name`
   * `outlet.N.type`
   * `battery.voltage.cell.max`, `battery.voltage.cell.min`
   * `battery.temperature.cell.max`, `battery.temperature.cell.min`
   * `battery.status`
   * `battery.capacity.nominal`
   * `battery.date.maintenance` (and clarified purpose of `battery.date`)
   * `battery.packs.external` (and clarified purpose of `battery.packs`)
   * `experimental.*` namespace introduced [PR #1046] to facilitate
     introduction of NUT drivers and their data points for which we do
     not yet have concepts, or which the original driver contributors
     did not map well per suitable NUT standards: this allows to balance
     having those drivers available in the project vs. least surprise
     for when the explicitly experimental names are changed to something
     stable and standardized.
   * Proposed to track Date and Time values (still as "opaque strings")
     preferably in representations compatible to ISO-8601/RFC-3339 [PR #1076]
     (standards update; changes to actual codebase to be applied in the future)
   ** New routine to convert a US formatted date string "MM/DD/YYYY" to an
      ISO 8601 Calendar date "YYYY-MM-DD" was added to snmp-ups.c [PR #1078]

 - Master/Slave terminology was deprecated in favor of Primary/Secondary
   modes of `upsmon` client:
   * Respective keywords in the configuration files (`upsd.users` and
     `upsmon.conf`) are supported as backwards-compatible settings,
     but the obsoleted values are no longer documented.
   * Protocol keyword support was similarly updated, with `upsmon` now
     first trying to elevate privileges with `PRIMARY <ups>` request,
     and falling back to `MASTER <ups>` just in case it talks to an
     older build of an `upsd` server.
   * For the principle of least surprise, NUT codebase still exposes the
     `net_master()` (as handler for `MASTER` net command) in header and
     C code for the sake of existing linked binaries, and returns the
     `OK MASTER-GRANTED` line to the older client that invoked it.
   * Newly introduced `net_primary()` (as handler for `PRIMARY` net command)
     calls the exact same application logic, but returns `OK PRIMARY-GRANTED`
     line to the client.
   * Python binding updated to handle both cases, as the only found in-tree
     protocol consumer of the full-line text.
   * For more details see issue #840 and several pull requests referenced
     from it, and discussions on NUT mailing lists.

 - Build fixes:
   * In general, numerous fixes were applied to ensure portability and avoid
     warnings (fixing a number of real bugs that caused them); CI was extended
     to keep the codebase free of those types of warnings which we have got
     rid of, requiring builds to succeed cleanly in several dozen combinations
     of compiler versions, C standard revisions (C99 upwards, though on many
     OSes with GNU99+ extensions), operating systems and CPU architectures.
   * Public CI introduced to automatically test every contribution (PR) and
     resulting increment of main NUT codebase, including Travis CI and LGTM.com
     services, and a Jenkins farm on virtual hardware donated by Fosshost.org;
     this augments testing earlier provided for some branches by Buildbot.
   * Added cppunit testing with valgrind for the C++ client library
   * Make targets added for shell script syntax checks for helper and service
     scripts
   * Make targets added for spellcheck and for maintenance of the dictionary,
     including incremental spellcheck to only parse recently edited text files
   * The AsciiDoc detection has been reworked to allow NUT to be built from
     source without requiring asciidoc/a2x (using pre-built man pages from
     the distribution tarball, for instance)
   * Makefile contents rearranged for more resilient out-of-tree and in-tree
     builds beside those made from the root workspace directory
   * Makefiles are tested with GNU Make and BSD Make to ensure portable recipes
   * More use of `pkg-config` to detect dependencies at configure time, as
     well as fail-safe detection of presence of pkg-config (and its macros)
     to survive and build without it too
   * "slibtool" pedantic nuances now supported, allowing an alternative to
     GNU libtool
   * Build scripts updated to remove obsoleted calls to cleanly work with
     autoconf-2.70 releases in 2020 (also works with 2.69 which was the
     earlier release since 2012)
   * Dynamic library loading used in certain programs and use-cases improved,
     especially for 64-bit vs 32-bit builds on multiple-bitness OSes
   * Logging routines like `upsdebugx()` were refactored as macros so there
     is slightly less overhead when logging is disabled [PRs #685 and #1100]
   * Numerous classes of compilation warnings eradicated, many of those being
     potential issues with implicit data type conversions and varied numeric
     type width, signedness, string buffer size, uninitialized variables or
     structure fields; some more in progress
   * Several logical errors found and fixed during this walk over codebase.
   * Cases where compilers were overly zealous and particular code was written
     the way wit was intentionally, including some comparisons that help with
     different-bitness builds but indeed seem superfluous in a certain single
     bitness, were commented and encased in pragmas to disable the warnings
   * Basic coding style (indentations, lack of trailing white space) applied
     per developer guide, but not automatically enforced/checked yet.

 - Due to changes needed to resolve build warnings, mostly about mismatching
   data types for some variables, some structure definitions and API signatures
   of several routines had to be changed for argument types, return types,
   or both. Primarily this change concerns internal implementation details
   (may impact update of NUT forks with custom drivers using those), but a
   few changes also happened in header files installed for builds configured
   `--with-dev` and so may impact `upsclient` and `nutclient` (C++) consumers.
   At the very least, binaries for those consumers should be rebuilt to remain
   stable with NUT 2.8.0 and not mismatch int-type sizes and other arguments.

 - As usual, more bugfixes, cleanup and improvements, on both source code
   and documentation.

 - al175: re-introduced this driver (actually, it was in 2.7.1)

 - upsdrvctl now provides retry options for upsdrvctl and driver(s)

 - snmp-ups: add support for XPPC-MIB and Tripp Lite SU10KRT3/1X.
   Also fix erroneous status in HP/Compaq SNMP MIB (with the most recent HP
   firmware (1.76); improved various MIBs (APC, HP/Compaq, ...)

 - nutdrv_qx: add new 'fallback' Q1 subdriver, with minimal 'Q1' support.
   General improvements on all subdrivers.

 - mge-shut: partially revert PnP/RTS change, for initializing the
   communication with the UPS. Note that nut-scanner similar function was
   not modified however.

 - FreeBSD DEVD support: generate devd.conf files for USB UPSes
   This adds a --with-devd-dir=PATH option to ./configure

 - The NUT website was moved to a standalone website. A separate code
   repository and source archive are now available.

 - As usual, more bugfixes, cleanup and improvements, on both source code
   and documentation.


Release notes for NUT 2.7.1 - what's new since 2.6.5
----------------------------------------------------

NOTE: There was no public NUT 2.7.0 release.

 - This release is an interim release, part of the testing series, and the
   first release after the transition from Subversion to Git.
   The last release (2.6.5) is almost a year old. A lot of work has
   been done, but a good amount remains to achieve 2.8.0 goals.
   Please read the link:UPGRADING.adoc[] notes.

 - Added support for SSL via the Mozilla NSS library, in addition to the
   existing OpenSSL support.

 - Added a new driver, nutdrv_qx, for Megatec/Qx devices. This driver will
   eventually replace the blazer_ser and blazer_usb drivers. In particular, it
   adds support for Voltronic Power devices.

 - Increased USB_TIMEOUT to standards-compliant 5.000 seconds in most drivers.
   This should reduce the number of timeouts on low-speed USB 1.1 devices.

 - The jNut Java source has been split into a separate GitHub repository.

 - Added many devices to the HCL. Of particular note are many Tripp Lite USB
   HID PDC models which were tested against NUT by Tripp Lite.

 - Reworked some visual elements of the HCL. The output is better tailored for
   graphical and text-only browsers, but suggestions are welcome for additional
   accessibility enhancements.

 - Also increased timeouts and added redundant commands to improve reliability
   of mge-utalk driver.

 - Added the apcupsd-ups driver to interoperate with apcupsd installations.

 - Added documentation on creating subdrivers for snmp-ups and nutdrv_qx.

 - Added new drivers for the Riello UPS product line (riello_ser/riello_usb).

 - Many improvements to the BCM/XCP drivers have been merged in. This includes
   an improved data reception loop, and additional mappings.

 - Added a few variables to the Powercom HID mappings.

 - Updated the apcsmart driver, and renamed the previous driver to apcsmart-old.

 - Fixed the battery percentage calculation in the bestfcom driver.

 - libnutclient has been added as a C++ alternative to libupsclient.

 - Packaging files for Solaris and HP-UX (sponsored by Eaton)

 - Fix shutdown of Eaton HID, using usbhid-ups and mge-shut

 - usbhid-ups: final fix for APC Back UPS ES.  APC Back UPS ES devices have
   buggy firmware, and this version does not cause a regression. The max_report
   variable should be set automatically based on the USB identification values.
   * UPDATE: known as `maxreport` flag for `usbhid-ups` driver, and as a
     `max_report_size` setting in code, as of NUT v2.8.2 release.

 - nut-scanner: fix crash

 - IPMI support can handle more different versions of FreeIPMI

 - Support power supplies scan over the network
   nut-scanner can now scan for power supplies with IPMI over LAN.
   This is currently limited to IPMI 1.5 only

 - Implement a framework to spell check documentation source files,
   using Aspell. This includes an interactive build target (make
   spellcheck-interactive), and an automated one (make spellcheck),
   mainly for QA / Buildbot purpose. Note that a base NUT dictionary
   is also available (link:docs/nut.dict[]), providing a glossary of
   terms related to power devices and management

 - Improve systemd integration

 - snmp-ups: Fixed a crash on outlet management, and added delta_ups MIB
   support. Also fixed mappings for upsBypassVoltage, upsBypassCurrent, and
   upsBypassPower in three-phase IETF MIB.


Release notes for NUT 2.6.5 - what's new since 2.6.4
----------------------------------------------------

 - This release fixes an important regression in upssched:
   any upssched.conf command that takes a second argument resulted in
   a defective frame sent to the parent process. Thus, the command was
   not executed (report and patch from Oliver Schonefeld)

 - Website hosting: free NUT from Eaton website hosting
   +
   +
   NUT website (https://www.networkupstools.org) is no longer hosted by Eaton.
   Arnaud Quette (NUT project leader) has taken over NUT hosting on his own,
   to give NUT back some independence.
   +
   +
   This effort is also part of a logic to stop crediting Eaton for
   contributions from others (especially Arnaud Quette, as an individual).
   The new hosting service is located, as for Arnaud's blog
   (http://arnaud.quette.fr) on Gandi servers, using PaaS.
   +
   +
   This will allow more flexibility and automation of the release process.

 - macosx-ups: new OS X Power Sources meta-driver
   * Mac OS X provides UPS status information in a format similar to
     what is shown for laptop batteries. This driver will convert that
     information into a format compatible with NUT (Charles Lepple).

 - support for new devices:
   * Eaton ePDU Switched
   * Online Zinto A (USB ID 0x06da:0x0601)
   * REDi Blazer 400VA / 600VA / 800VA
   * UNITEK Alpha650ipF and Alpha650ipE (USB ID 0x0f03:0x0001)

 - mge-shut driver has been replaced by a new implementation (newmge-shut).
   In case of issue with this new version, users can revert to oldmge-shut.
   UPDATE: oldmge-shut was dropped between 2.7.4 and 2.8.0 releases.

 - First NUT virtualization package: NUT now supports integration with
   VMware ESXI 5.0, through a native VIB package. This is, for the time
   being, an external effort from René Garcia (refer to the Download section
   on NUT website). But work is underway to improve this integration, and
   include it in the NUT source tree

 - IPMI support (nut-ipmipsu driver and nut-scanner): prepare for supporting
   API changes in upcoming FreeIPMI versions 1.1.x and 1.2.x.

 - snmp-ups now supports high precision values for APC, and more variables

 - the NUT variables and commands namespace has been fixed and
   completed, with the known and used variables that were missing.

 - more bugfixes, cleanup and improvements, on both source code and
   documentation.


Release notes for NUT 2.6.4 - what's new since 2.6.3
----------------------------------------------------

 - This release fixes an important vulnerability in upsd
   (CVE-2012-2944: upsd can be remotely crashed)
   +
   +
   NUT server (upsd), from versions 2.4.0 to 2.6.3, are exposed to
   crashes when receiving random data from the network.
   +
   +
   This issue is related to the way NUT parses characters,
   especially from the network. Non printable characters were missed
   from strings operation (such as strlen), but still copied to the
   buffer, causing an overflow.
   +
   +
   Thus, fix NUT parser, to only allow the subset of ASCII charset from
   `Space` to `~`
   (Reported by Sebastian Pohle, Alioth bug #313636, CVE-2012-2944)
   +
   +
   A separate patch, which applies to any faulty version, is also available:
   http://trac.networkupstools.org/projects/nut/changeset/3633
   +
   +
   For more information, refer to the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures:
   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-2944

 - A static source code analysis has been done by Michal Hlavinka from RedHat,
   using Coverity (12 issues fixed).

 - Add new "LIST CLIENTS" and "NETVER" commands to NUT network protocol.
   "NETVER" allows to retrieve the Network protocol version, while
   "LIST CLIENTS" provides the list of clients connected to a device.
   Refer to the developer guide, "Network protocol information" section for
   more information.

 - Support of ranges of values for writable variables has been added, to
   complete the existing enumerated values mechanism. This will start to
   appear in some drivers soon, beginning with Eaton. Refer to the developer
   guide, "Creating a new driver..." section for more information.

----------------------------------------------------

 - nut-scanner is now more portable, and provides more coherent option names.
   IPMI support has also been added, to discover local power supplies.
   This version brings weak runtime dependencies in libnutscan, which allows to
   compile nut-scanner with all options and to run according to the available
   dependencies (USB, SNMP, IPMI, ...).

   interface is available. This is needed on systems where either IPv4 or IPv6
   is disabled, and no explicit LISTEN directive has been specified.

 - Avahi support is now automatically enabled, upon detection

 - jNut (NUT Java interface) adds device discovery support, through a
   nut-scanner wrapper; jNutWebAPI, a HTTP/JSON web service interface, has
   also been added to interact with upsd and nut-scanner.

 - Base files for HPUX packaging have been added. This is still a work in
   progress.

 - Compilation on IBM AIX has been fixed (namespace conflict with ctypes).

 - more bugfixes, cleanup and improvements, on both source code and
   documentation.


Release notes for NUT 2.6.2 - what's new since 2.6.1
----------------------------------------------------

 - NUT can now monitor power supply units (PSU) in servers, through IPMI, using
   the new experimental 'nut-ipmipsu' driver. Users are encouraged to test it,
   and send feedback and debug output to the development mailing list.
   This requires GNU FreeIPMI (0.8.5 or higher) development package or files.
   Thanks goes to Al Chu, FreeIPMI project leader, for his help during this
   development.

 - NUT now provides a tool, called 'nut-scanner', to discover supported devices,
   both local and remote. nut-scanner will help to ease the configuration step,
   and power infrastructure discovery.
   +
   +
   This development, sponsored by Eaton, supports the following methods:
   * USB,
   * SNMP,
   * XML/HTTP (from Eaton),
   * NUT servers, using the classic connect or Avahi / mDNS methods.
   +
   +
   IPMI support will be added in the next release.
   +
   +
   A separate library, called 'libnutscan', is also available to provide these
   feature. Future NUT releases will provides binding for the supported
   languages (Perl, Python and Java).

 - NUT now provides a Java interface called 'jNut'.
   This development, sponsored by Eaton, is currently limited to the client
   interface. But it will be broaden to device discovery and configuration in
   the future.
   +
   +
   For more info, refer to nut/scripts/java/README, or the developer guide
   (chapter 'Creating new client'). Javadoc documentation is also provided,
   along with Java archives (.jar) in the Download section.

 - support for new devices:
   * Eaton 3S
   * Cyber Power Systems CP1000AVRLCD
   * various APC models equipped with APC AP9618 management card, including
     APC Smart-UPS RT XL
   * Orvaldi 750 / 900SP
   * POWEREX VI 1000 LED
   * PowerWalker VI 850 LCD
   * SVEN Power Pro+ series (USB ID ffff:0000)

 - A regression has been fixed in udev rules file. This previously caused
   permission issues to owners of some USB devices.

 - Avahi support has been added, for NUT mDNS publication, through a static
   service file (nut/scripts/avahi/nut.service).

 - usbhid-ups has had Eaton completion: some features have been improved, such
   as 'output.voltage.nominal'; 3S Eco control support has been added, along
   with battery.runtime.low and end of battery life (life cycle monitoring)
   support; new measurements for 5 PX are also supported now (outlet power
   factor, power, real power and current).

 - apcsmart has been updated to support more variables and features; the
   previous driver is however still available as 'apcsmart-old', in case of
   issues.

 - bcmxcp now supports per outlet startup and shutdown delays setting; shutdown
   delay is also used, when available, for outlet.n.shutdown.return instead of
   the default 3 seconds.

 - snmp-ups.c has a new initialization method, that uses sysObjectID, which is
   a pointer to the preferred MIB of the device, to detect supported devices.
   This speeds up even more init stage and should render void the use of 'mib'
   option. SNMP v3 session initialization has also been fixed, and Eaton PDU
   support has been completed.

 - Initial support has been added for systemd, the System and Service Manager
   from RedHat.

 - The chapter 'NUT configuration management with Augeas' of the developer guide
   has received some completion: a complete Python Augeas example code is now
   provided.

 - Finally, after years of dedication to NUT, Arjen de Korte is now retired.
   Sincere thanks to you Arjen from us all.

   also received some more care, like bugfixes and new models support and
   enhancement for Solaris.
   [Peter Selinger and Arnaud Quette]

 - A bug has been fixed in NUT core to support resuming from suspend-to-disk.
   This should also fix other similar issues, like time synchronization
   through the NTP - Network Time Protocol.
   [Arjen de Korte]

 - The mge-shut driver now better detects the Low Battery status, support
   new models and fixes some wrong status and data. It also fixes some
   issue where the UPS wasn't restarting (refer to mge-shut manpage).

   also received some attention.
   [Carlos Rodrigues]

 - The new rhino driver was added to support Microsol Rhino UPS hardware
   The solis has also been improved for Solaris compatibility, and
   internal / external shutdown programming. solis can now save external
   shutdown programming to ups, and support new cables for solis 3
   [Silvino B. MagalhÃ£es]

----------------------------------------------------

 - The bestuferrups driver has been forked into the new bestfcom driver
   which has better handling of the inverter status alarm messages and
   more.
   [Kent Hill]

 - Mustek UPS support returns with two drivers which have overlapping
   coverage: mustek and powermust.
   [powermust: Carlos Rodrigues, mustek: Martin Hajduch]

 - Additional CyberPower Systems hardware is supported with the new

   [Yuri Elizarov]

 - The victronups driver is now at version 0.1.9, which adds many
   instant commands: calibration control, battery and front panel tests,
   and bypass control.
   [Gert Lynge]

 - The tripplite driver has received a major overhaul to bring it up to
   working condition for the 2.0 tree, including code cleanups, several
   new variables, commands, and user-definable parameters.  See
   ChangeLog for more.
   [Nicholas J Kain]

 - The mge-utalk driver has been upgraded to version 0.81, which fixes
   the lack of read-write variables and loss of sync on models which
   don't support restoring settings.
   [Arnaud Quette]

 - The Micro Ferrups model RE is now supported by the bestuferrups
   driver.  The driver will also now read the ambient temperature and
   will no longer constantly report the data as stale.
   [Tim Thompson]

 - The fentonups driver's init sequence has been reworked to work better
   with some hardware, including a fix to the parser code.
   [MLH]

 - A workaround has been added to the hidups driver to avoid variables
   which are stuck by calling HIDIOCINITREPORT in every poll.
   [Stuart D. Gathman]

 - SOLA 610 UPS hardware and others which do not support the ID command
   may now be monitored by the bestups driver after forcing ID= in
   ups.conf.
   [Jason White]

 - "pollinterval" is now available via driver.parameter for consistency.
   [Arnaud Quette]

 - The mge-shut and newhidups drivers, along with the supporting
   hidparser/libhid code have received many updates, including lowering
   USB bandwidth consumption, driver unbinding (only in Linux), code
   cleanups, and more which can be seen in the ChangeLog file.
   [Arnaud Quette]

 - The fentonups driver now recognizes several more Megatec protocol
   units:
   * SuperPower HP360, Hope-550	[Denis Zaika]
   * Unitek Alpha 1000is	[Antoine Cuvellard]

 - Some variables like uc_sigmask were renamed to avoid clashes with
   symbols on systems like HP/UX.

 - All man pages have been reworked to switch literal "-" characters to
   hyphens or "\-" as appropriate.
   [Shaul Karl]

 - upssched's CANCEL events were broken following the change to
   text-based socket messages in 1.5 and have been fixed.
   [Steven Schoch]

 - Calls to varargs functions with raw strings from the config files
   without an intervening "%s" have been fixed in upsmon, upssched,
   snmp-ups and upsd.
   [Ulf Harnhammar]


Release notes for NUT 2.0.0 - what's new since 1.4.x
----------------------------------------------------

 - The new naming scheme for variables and commands (introduced in 1.4)
   is now mandatory.  The 1.4 tree supported both the old (STATUS) and
   the new (ups.status) as a transitional release, and now that time is
   over.
   +
   +
   This means that 2.0 is generally smaller than 1.4 code, since the
   interim compatibility hacks have been removed.

 - New serial handling code has been added, with greatly simplified
   operations.  The old mess involving repeated calls to sigaction,
   alarm, and read has been condensed to a select-read loop.
   +
   +
   This change allows drivers which don't do any serial communications
   at all (hidups, snmp-ups) to drop that baggage, so they are a bit
   smaller when compiled.

 - The drivers now recognize "chroot=' and 'user=' in the global section
   of ups.conf.  This means you don't have to use -r and -u when
   starting upsdrvctl.

 - upsmon now supports the -K argument to check for the presence of the
   POWERDOWNFLAG file.  If it exists and contains the magic string, then
   upsmon will exit(EXIT_SUCCESS).  Otherwise, it will
   exit(EXIT_FAILURE).
   +
   +
   This feature can be used to simplify shutdown scripts, since now you
   don't have to keep the script in sync with the upsmon.conf.

 - Many small things like signed value comparisons, int vs. size_t and
   proper use of const/struct were fixed throughout the source.  These
   were mostly for correctness, but a few potential bugs involving very
   big or very small numbers were fixed at the same time.

 - The access control system in upsd.conf has been reworked and
   simplified.  Since access levels have become meaningless in recent
   releases, the new system is just ACCEPT <acl> or REJECT <acl>.
   +
   +
   If you are upgrading from a previous version of the software, you
   will have to edit your upsd.conf to use this method.  See
   the link:UPGRADING.adoc[] file for more details.

 - The build process now halts when make fails in one of the
   subdirectories.
   [Petter Reinholdtsen, Charles Lepple]

 - Helper data for using upsclient via pkgconfig is now created if
   pkgconfig is detected when configure runs.
   [Arnaud Quette]

 - The polling interval in drivers may now be set with 'pollinterval'
   in ups.conf.
   [Gabriel Faber]

 - Blazer UPS equipment is now supported with the blazer driver.
   [Phil Hutton]

 - Energizer USB UPS hardware is now supported on Linux with a new
   experimental driver.
   [Viktor T. Toth]

 - The newhidups driver has been merged as the first step towards
   portable USB UPS support.  This will eventually replace the old
   Linux-only hidups driver.  The newhidups driver is tagged
   experimental since it is under active development.
   [Arnaud Quette, Charles Lepple]

 - The newapc driver has been renamed to apcsmart, replacing the old
   driver with that name. If you used the newapc driver, be sure to
   delete the old binary and fix your ups.conf.

 - The apcsmart driver now supports asynchronous notification data
   from the hardware, which means it can wake up as soon as something
   happens.  This affects the OL/OB/LB/RB data in ups.status, and
   generally reduces the latency in dispatching status changes by a few
   seconds.

 - The apcsmart driver can now support quirky hardware which does not
   provide the usual listing of valid command characters.  This feature
   is necessary to monitor new models like the APC CS 350 and old ones
   like the Matrix 5000.  It also now has sdtype=4 to handle the strange
   shutdown behavior on the CS series.

 - The belkin driver now works around broken firmware version 001,
   avoiding a lengthy delay at startup.  It also implements the shutdown
   sequence differently, and should actually work on more hardware now.

 - The bestups driver has been slowed down to play nicer with the
   hardware, and is much more reliable as a result.  Among other things,
   it should always detect the UPS on the first try, meaning no more
   "dot dot dot" when it starts.

 - The cyberpower driver is no longer tagged experimental, and now
   supports powering off the load.  It also supports battery tests via
   instcmds.

 - Effekta MT 2000 RM hardware is now supported by the fentonups driver.
   [Christoph Moar]

 - The new safenet driver supports UPS hardware that uses the protocol
   of the same name.  This includes models from many manufacturers,
   including Fairstone, Fenton, Gemini, Powerwell, Repotec, Soltec and
   Sweex.  See the README or driver.list for the full details.
   [Arjen de Korte]

 - The genericups driver now has type 20 to monitor the Powerware 5119
   RM.  See http://lists.exploits.org/ups/Oct2003/00052.html.
   [Daniel Thompson]

 - The belkinunv driver has been added to allow monitoring Belkin
   Universal UPS hardware.
   [Peter Selinger]

 - Cyber Power Systems 1100AVR hardware which has a different protocol
   than the existing binary type (supported by 'cyberpower') is now
   supported by the experimental cyberpower1100 driver.
   [Walt Holman]

 - upsdrvctl now returns success or failure information in the exit
   code.  Any failure during a requested operation will result in a
   nonzero value (specifically EXIT_FAILURE).


Release notes for NUT 1.4.0 - what's new since 1.2.x
----------------------------------------------------

 - The drivers and upsd now communicate over Unix domain sockets instead
   of state files, shared memory, or state files with mmap.  This change
   makes many things possible, including the new dynamic variable and
   command naming scheme described below.
   +
   +
   There is a new development tool called sockdebug in the server
   directory for debugging driver-server communications on the sockets.

 - The old static variable scheme has been replaced by a new dynamic
   implementation.  Vague names have been turned into meaningful names
   that fit into an organized system.  UTILITY is now input.voltage.
   OUTVOLT is now output.voltage.
   +
   +
   This also applies to the names of instant commands.  BTEST1 is
   test.battery.start, and BTEST0 is test.battery.stop.
   +
   +
   The old names are still supported for compatibility with older
   clients.  This compatibility mode will be maintained throughout
   the 1.4 series, and will be gone by the release of 2.0.  Users
   with older clients are encouraged to upgrade their software
   during this time.

 - The network protocol has been expanded to handle these new names.
   Older functions which only apply to the old names will continue to
   be supported through the 1.4 series.

 - The drivers and server (upsd) can now change their user ids and
   chroot themselves with the new -u and -r arguments.  This lets you
   create a "chroot jail" with the bare minimum components.
   +
   +
   This technique is used to provide a higher degree of security.  If
   someone exploited upsd to get a shell somehow, they would be stuck
   in the jail.

 - upssched now explicitly confirms reception of timer commands before
   exiting.  This was done to avoid a race where one process would
   exit right when another one was starting.  The second one would
   believe its command had been handled when it had been lost.

 - upslog has been reworked to use standard getopt parsing to provide
   the monitoring settings.  The old way of specifying arguments is
   still supported for backwards compatibility.
   +
   +
   upslog has also been changed to only parse the format string once,
   rather than doing it every time through the loop.  This should
   provide a minuscule drop in CPU utilization.

 - Usernames are now required in upsmon and upsd.  This means that you
   must add a username to your MONITOR lines in upsmon.conf and then
   create a matching user in upsd.users.
   +
   +
   Installations from the 1.2 era probably already used usernames, so
   this mostly affects those from 1.0 and before.

 - Drivers are now pinged regularly by upsd when they aren't posting
   updates about the UPS status.  This provides another check in the
   data validation process.  If upsd fails to get a response within
   a few seconds, the UPS will be marked stale.

 - A few minor memory leaks were discovered with valgrind and squashed.

 - upsstats now reuses connections to upsd when cycling through multiple
   entries in the hosts.conf.  This makes things a bit faster and
   avoids some of the noise in the syslog.
   +
   +
   This only applies to entries that are adjacent.  To take advantage
   of this feature, you may have to rearrange them per example below.
   +
   +
   Connection reuse for nonadjacent entries may be considered in the
   future.
----
	MONITOR ups-1@host-1 ...
	MONITOR ups-1@host-2 ...
	MONITOR ups-2@host-2 ...
	MONITOR ups-3@host-3 ...
----

 - upsd now warns about insecure configuration files at startup.
   These files (upsd.conf, upsd.users, and the certfile) should
   only be readable by upsd.  Never make them world-readable.

 - The programs no longer print "shutting down" when they are just
   exiting.  This was changed to avoid confusion about the term, since
   "shutting down" has a special meaning in UPS software.

 - Signal handlers no longer do any significant amount of work.  Some of
   the programs used to do numerous things in there, raising concerns
   about reentrancy.  They now set flags and allow the main loop to do
   the actual work from there.

 - A bug in upsmon where NOTIFYFLAG settings could be ignored was fixed.

 - Group handling has been changed.  configure no longer accepts
   --with-group, and the programs no longer setgid() to a hardcoded
   value.  They now setgid() to the primary group of whatever the
   user value may be.
   +
   +
   This may be compiled in with --with-user as before, and many programs
   accept -u to override it at runtime.

 - The state path is no longer created during 'make install'.  Users
   are now expected to create it themselves.  This removes a lot of
   evil complexity from the build and install sequences.

 - upsd no longer implements the DROP access command, as it
   could confuse the clients by getting them out of sync.  DROP is now
   implemented as DENY, which sends an error message.  If you use DROP,
   you should change it to DENY rather than relying on this
   compatibility measure.

 - The belkin driver no longer reports OFF and OL at the same time.

 - The bestups driver no longer sleeps during polls, which makes it
   more responsive to things like instant commands.

 - The cyberpower driver now has much better hardware detection code
   and no longer freezes at startup under some conditions.  It also now
   supports the shutdown function.  Instant commands for shutdowns and
   battery tests were also added.

 - The dummyups testing driver has been removed.  The dummycons testing
   driver can do everything that dummyups once did and much more.
   dummycons is also now built by default for easier testing.

 - The newapc driver has been reworked to take advantage of the new
   internal driver state functions.  Some variables without an obvious
   purpose were dropped.

 - The newapc driver now sends all five bytes when using sdtype 1.
   Previously it didn't send the entire string, and it didn't work.
   [Don Lewis]

 - The hidups driver has been expanded to allow for setting variables,
   a shutdown sequence, and more.
   [Arnaud Quette]

 - The mge-utalk driver had trouble establishing communications in
   some cases due to the RTS line being set.  This has been fixed.
   +
   +
   The mge-shut driver has been added to the tree, and has replaced
   the older mge-ellipse driver.
   [Arnaud Quette, Philippe Marzouk]

 - Outlet-level control has been defined in the variable tree, and will
   be added to drivers where the hardware supports it.  This can be
   used to shut down some components earlier than others to prolong
   your runtime on battery.
   +
   +
   This is supported in the mge-shut driver now, and may show up in
   others before long.
   [Arnaud Quette]

 - KIN-2200AP hardware is now recognized by the powercom driver.
   This change may also support other KIN-xxxxAP equipment.
   [Preston A. Elder]

 - The 1.1kVA UPS is now supported by the bestuferrups driver.  This
   driver was also changed to allow easy addition of more models
   in the future.
   [Bob Apodaca]

 - The fentonups driver can now handle devices which implement the
   "I" detection differently, and now supports the Giant/WELI 500
   as a result.
   [Joon Guillen]

 - The serial number of the UPS being monitored can now be specified
   with serial= in ups.conf in the genericups driver.
   [Shaul Karl]

 - The newapc driver now sends ESC to break out of menus when the
   initial detection fails.  Some new APC models have interactive menus
   on the serial port, and the driver couldn't handle them before.

 - The snmp-ups driver now reports ambient temperature and humidity
   data for APC equipment.  It also now supports the shutdown.reboot and
   shutdown.reboot.graceful commands.
   [Dmitry Frolov]

 - The list of supported variables and commands in the snmp-ups driver
   has been expanded.
   [Arnaud Quette, J.W. Hoogervorst]

 - Various drivers now report bypass mode with the BYP status word.
   [Arnaud Quette]

 - Energy Sistem equipment is now supported with the esupssmart driver.
   [Antonio Trujillo Coronado]

 - The Tripp-Lite SU series (SmartOnline) is supported with the new
   tripplitesu driver.
   [Allan Hessenflow]

 - The HP PowerTrust A2994A is now recognized by the hp driver.
   [Jan Sporbeck]

 - Many drivers were cleaned up to perform basic sanity checks on the
   status data before using it.

 - An explicit cleanup function has been added to the driver core to
   ensure that all dynamic resources are freed before exiting.  This
   is part of the larger process to check for memory leaks and other
   bad things.
   [Arnaud Quette]

 - upsd now provides variable descriptions from an auxiliary file.
   This file is optional, which allows for a smaller memory footprint.
   It can also be edited for localization or other customizations.

 - upsimage and upsstats can now render BATTVOLT data.
   [Andrew R. Ghali]

 - String handling has been cleaned up throughout the tree.  Calls to
   functions like strcpy and strcat were either replaced with other
   (range-checking) functions or were rewritten to avoid it.

 - Many compile-time defaults may now be overridden at runtime.  In
   the environment NUT_CONFPATH and NUT_STATEPATH may be used.
   upsdrvctl has been changed to execve to pass these along to the
   drivers.  ups.conf now supports driverpath=, and upsd.conf supports
   DATAPATH.
   [Bryan Henderson]

 - The configure --with-gd switches now actually do something useful
   when gd has been installed outside the default search directories.
   [Patrik Schindler]

 - The inline keyword is now handled properly on systems which do not
   support it or have it specified as another name.  This was breaking
   compiles on some systems.
   [Petter Reinholdtsen]


Release notes for NUT 1.2.2 - what's new since 1.2.1
----------------------------------------------------

 - The snmp-ups driver has been upgraded and expanded.  It now supports
   multiple MIBs, meaning it can handle RFC 1628, APCC, and MGE
   equipment.  You can pick the right one with "mibs=" in ups.conf.
   +
   +
   Support for setting variable and instant commands is also available.
   [Arnaud Quette and Dmitry Frolov]

 - The powernet driver has been upgraded.  It now supports more
   variables, has cleaner logging, and may now be considered stable.
   [Dmitry Frolov]

 - The hidups driver now supports physical port IDs.  This avoids most
   of the problems where the hiddev* names can jump around too easily.
   It will now stay in the same place as long as you keep it plugged
   into the same physical port.  See the ChangeLog file for more details.
   [David Brownell]

 - The hidups driver now also supports the MFR variable on APC
   Back-UPS ES equipment.
   [Jonathan A. Davis]

 - The sms driver has been updated to version 0.70.
   [Marcio Gomes]

 - The bestups driver now recognizes Best Power Axxium Rackmount
   equipment.
   [Ales Casar]

 - The liebert driver now uses O_NONBLOCK, and should now work
   consistently on OpenBSD as a result.
   [Alex Cichowski]

 - The liebert driver also now uses debouncing logic on the status
   lines.  It was possible to get false readings that would start a
   shutdown or just annoy users with excessive onbatt/online notify
   messages.  The new code forces the status to settle down for 3 polls
   before accepting the new value.
   +
   +
   This means that very short power events may not be detected.  The
   alternative is having your machine shut down just because it decided
   to wiggle over to OB LB for a few seconds.

 - upsmon has had the disconnect logic fixed so the "communications
   lost" (COMMBAD) notify will actually go out when the connection
   fails.

 - upssched now uses a lock file to prevent a race where two could
   start at the same time.  The second upssched would "win", and the
   first one would be unreachable.  This had the side-effect of not
   being able to cancel timers on the first one.

   If you use upssched, you must define the LOCKFN directive when
   upgrading to this version, or it will not work.

 - The packaging and scripts for Red Hat systems have been updated.
   [Antonino Albanese]

 - upsd is now a bit more lenient about access levels in the
   'numlogins' check, which is what caused the problem in upsmon
   (next item).

 - upsmon no longer gets stuck in slavesync() when upsd is configured
   to drop certain queries.  This usually happened at the worst
   possible time: in the middle of a shutdown.
   [John David Garza]

 - The upsclient functions now do more sanity checking on data from
   upsd so a short read won't return garbage to the callers.

 - upsset now works properly with ENUM/VARTYPE values for multiple
   UPSes on a single upsd.
   [Dmitry Frolov]

 - Various portability fixes for building on SGI were applied.
   [Andrea Suatoni]

 - upsd no longer tries to reference a deleted client structure if the
   client disconnects at the wrong time.  Previously, it tried to use
   that pointer after the sendback() function had already failed on
   write and deleted the client.  This could cause upsd to segfault
   depending on what areas were accessed.

Release notes for NUT 1.2.1 - what's new since 1.2.0
----------------------------------------------------

 - The sms driver is back, with support for Microlink Manager III
   hardware. [Marcio Gomes]

 - Fideltronik Ares Series hardware is now supported as genericups
   type 19.  [Tomek Orzechowski and Arkadiusz Mikiewicz]

 - The drivers no longer silently drop instant commands or set commands
   from upsd that happen to get fragmented in transit.
   [linux@horizon.com]

 - The old multilink driver is back with a new name: liebert.  It
   supports Liebert UPStation GXE hardware with the contact-closure
   cable.  This is currently an experimental driver as there is no
   way to power down the load.

 - configure now picks up the right flags for gd automatically if gd
   2.0.8 or higher is installed.  This greatly simplifies the CGI build
   process for most users.

 - Shutdowns on FreeBSD using the genericups driver should work again.
   [Petri Riihikallio]

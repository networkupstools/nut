// NOTE: The big block of comments and definitions below comes from
// NUT::docs/asciidoc-vars.conf and is included into top-level document
// sources by maintenance recipes directly (`make maintainer-asciidocs`),
// due to current limitations of the GitHub Web UI asciidoc renderer.
// Hopefully it can be dropped in favor of compact include definitions
// (see README.adoc for anticipated example) after this issue is resolved
// on their side:
// * https://github.com/github/markup/issues/1095
//
// This file should be included into NUT documentation sources to consistently
// define certain expandable attributes, with contents defined based on the
// rendition target (e.g. GitHub Web UI, plain text, locally built HTML/PDF...)
// Note that currently GitHub Web UI references lead to nut-website (as of
// last built and published revision), not to neighboring documents in the
// source browser (which would make sense for branch revisions, etc.) due
// to certain complexity about referencing other-document sections with a
// partially functional rendering engine there. Exploration and fixes are
// welcome (actually working links like
// https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/tree/master#installing or
// https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/blob/master/UPGRADING.adoc#changes-from-274-to-280
// do seem promising)!
//
// Since the GitHub UI does not allow use of custom asciidoc configuration
// files, or generally does not process the `include:` requests at this time,
// clumsy expandable attributes had to be used (usually a set including a
// prefix with meaningful name, and one or more separators and/or a suffix
// with shortened names). For our classic documentation renditions, they
// should resolve to properly defined macros from `docs/asciidoc.conf`
// (usually named same as the variables defined here, for simplicity):
// * `linksrcdoc` allows to refer to a source of documentation file
//   relative to the root of NUT code base.
// * `linkdoc` allows to refer to a file under `docs/` directory (or
//   its nut-website rendition).
// * `xref` substitutes the asciidoc shorthand '<< >>' syntax with
//   attributes that conditionally expand to:
//   - links on GitHub (references can point at most to a section of
//     level docs/common.xsl's <chunk.section.depth>), or
//   - xref asciidoc macros when generating docs.
// * `linksingledoc` guarantees that, when chunked HTML is generated,
//   the link always points to a non-chunked file.
// * `linkman2` allows to support different names for the manpage and
//   the command shown. This is also needed to properly display links
//   to manpages in both GitHub and generated docs without defining an
//   attribute for each manpage.
// * `linkmanext` and `linkmanext2` macros repeat the behavior of the default ones.
//   These macros are intended for system man pages (e.g. HTML links might lead
//   to a generic internet site, or possibly to a distro-provided library
//   online or locally).
//
// Optional attributes set by callers:
// * `website-url` (defaulted below) may be used for "historic website"
//   snapshot builds... hopefully
// * `website` is used as a boolean toggle in our recipes for nut-website
//   vs. offline documentation renditions
// * `env-github` is used as a boolean toggle, set by GitHub Web-UI renderer
// * `(top_)srcdir` and `(top_)builddir` can be set by `Makefile.am`
//   calling the `a2x` tool, since some of the files with the asciidoc
//   mark-up are only generated or post-processed during build and
//   (due to `make dist` restrictions) being build products, they may
//   not reside in same directory as static source text files which
//   reference or include them. Note that the non-`top` paths would
//   normally differ based on location of the `Makefile` involved
//   (e.g. workspace root, or the `docs`, or `docs/man` directories).
//   These variables are expected to be absolute paths, or ones relative
//   to asciidoc-selected `:base_dir`, and to end with a relevant path
//   separator, or be empty -- so in all cases letting the resulting
//   string resolve meaningfully in the filesystem during docs build.
//
// Please keep the remaining comments and definitions as one big block
// so it does not become a series of empty paragraphs in the rendered
// documents!

This chapter describes the various methods for installing Network UPS Tools.

Whenever it is possible, prefer <<Installing_packages, installing from packages>>.
Packagers have done an excellent and hard work at improving NUT integration
into their operating system.  On the other hand, distributions and appliances
tend to package "official releases" of projects such as NUT, and so do not
deliver latest and greatest fixes, new drivers, bugs and other features.

Stable distributions also tend to deliver minor fixes to the version of
third-party software (like NUT) a particular release of the operating
system has initially delivered, so those release lines can be years behind
development in terms of new features (or bug fixes, if they are not trivial
to patch into the old code base snapshot used to create the package).

[[Installing_source]]
Installing from source
----------------------

These are the essential steps for compiling and installing this software
from distribution archives (usually "release tarballs") which include a
pre-built copy of the `configure` script and some other generated source
files.

To build NUT from a Git checkout you may need some additional tools
(referenced just a bit below) and run `./autogen.sh` to generate the
needed files. For common developer iterations, porting to new platforms,
or in-place testing, running the `./ci_build.sh` script can be helpful.
The "<<Installing_inplace,Building NUT for in‐place upgrades or non‐disruptive
tests>>" section details some more hints about such workflow, including some
`systemd` integration.

The NUT linkdoc:packager-guide[Packager Guide], which presents the best
practices for installing and integrating NUT, is also a good reading.

The {linkdoc}qa-guide{ld-s}[NUT Quality Assurance Guide,NUT_Config_Prereqs,docs/config-prereqs.txt]
document suggests prerequisite packages with tools and dependencies
available and needed to build and test as much as possible of NUT on
numerous platforms, written from perspective of CI testing (if you
are interested in getting updated drivers for a particular device,
you might select a sub-set of those suggestions).

NOTE: This "Config Prereqs" document for latest NUT iteration can be found at
https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/blob/master/docs/config-prereqs.txt
or as `docs/config-prereqs.txt` in your build workspace (from Git or tarball).

[NOTE]
.Keep in mind that...
================================================================================

- the paths shown below are the default values you get by just calling
  configure by itself.  If you have used --prefix or similar, things will be
  different.  Also, if you didn't install this program from source yourself,
  the paths will probably have a number of differences.

- by default, your system probably won't find the man pages, since they
  install to /usr/local/ups/man.  You can fix this by editing your MANPATH,
  or just do this:

	man -M /usr/local/ups/man <man page>

- if your favorite system offers up to date binary packages, you should
  always prefer these over a source installation (unless there are known
  deficiencies in the package or one is too obsolete). Along with the known
  advantages of such systems for installation, upgrade and removal, there
  are many integration issues that have been addressed.

================================================================================


Prepare your system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

System User creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create at least one system user and a group for running this software.
You might call them "ups" and "nut".  The exact names aren't important as
long as you are consistent.

The process for doing this varies from one system to the next, and
explaining how to add users is beyond the scope of this document.

For the purposes of this document, the user name and group name
will be 'ups' and 'nut' respectively.

Be sure the new user is a member of the new group!  If you forget to
do this, you will have problems later on when you try to start upsd.


Build and install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NOTE: See also <<Installing_inplace,Building NUT for in‐place upgrades
or non‐disruptive tests>>.

[[Configuration]]
Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configure the source tree for your system.  Add the '--with-user' and
'--with-group' switch to set the user name and group that you created
above.

	./configure --with-user=ups --with-group=nut

If you need any other switches for configure, add them here.  For example:

* to build and install USB drivers, add '--with-usb' (note that you
  need to install libusb development package or files).

* to build and install SNMP drivers, add '--with-snmp' (note that
  you need to install libsnmp development package or files).

* to build and install CGI scripts, add '--with-cgi'.

See <<Configure_options,Configure options>> from the User Manual,
docs/configure.txt or './configure --help' for all the available
options.

If you alter paths with additional switches, be sure to use those
new paths while reading the rest of the steps.

Reference: <<Configure_options,Configure options>> from the
User Manual.


Build the programs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	make

This will build the NUT client and server programs and the
selected drivers. It will also build any other features that were
selected during <<Configuration,configuration>> step above.

NOTE: NUT is regularly tested with GNU, BSD and Sun implementations of `make`.


Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
You should now gain privileges for installing software if necessary, e.g.:

	su -

or prefix installation (not build/check!) commands with `sudo`, e.g.:

	sudo make install ...
=====================================================================

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
If you install NUT for direct consumption on the system that has just
built it from source, you might be aided for some of the steps listed
and explained below by running (as `root`):

	make install-as-root

This should not only install the software, but also create directories
such as the state path, assign ownership and access permissions to
certain directories and sample configuration files which NUT user
and/or group accounts should be able to read and/or write, and, on
some platforms, also (re-)start the NUT daemons/services.

See above "System User creation", that should be done first!
=====================================================================

Install the files to a system level directory:

	make install

This will install the compiled programs and man pages, as well as
some data files required by NUT. Any optional features selected
during configuration will also be installed.

This will also install sample versions of the NUT configuration
files. Sample files are installed with names like ups.conf.sample
so they will not overwrite any existing real config files you may
have created.

If you are packaging this software, then you will probably want to
use the DESTDIR variable to redirect the build into another place,
also known as a "prototype directory" or a "staging area", i.e.:

	make DESTDIR=/tmp/package install
	make DESTDIR=/tmp/package install-conf

[[StatePath]]
State path creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NOTE: See above about `make install-as-root`, if you use that -- skip
this step here.

Create the state path directory for the driver(s) and server to use
for storing UPS status data and other auxiliary files, and make it
group-writable by the group of the system user you created, e.g.:

	mkdir -p /var/state/ups
	chmod 0770 /var/state/ups
	chown root:nut /var/state/ups

[[Ownership]]
Ownership and permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Set ownership data and permissions on your serial or USB ports
that go to your UPS hardware.  Be sure to limit access to just
the user you created earlier.

These examples assume the second serial port (ttyS1) on a typical
Slackware system.  On FreeBSD, that would be cuaa1.  Serial ports
vary greatly, so yours may be called something else.

	chmod 0660 /dev/ttyS1
	chown root:nut /dev/ttyS1

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
FIXME: TBR
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The setup for USB ports is slightly more complicated. Device files
for USB devices, such as /proc/bus/usb/002/001, are usually
created "on the fly" when a device is plugged in, and disappear
when the device is disconnected.  Moreover, the names of these
device files can change randomly. To set up the correct
permissions for the USB device, you may need to set up (operating
system dependent) hotplugging scripts.  Sample scripts and
information are provided in the scripts/hotplug and
scripts/udev directories. For most users, the hotplugging scripts
will be installed automatically by "make install".

(If you want to try if a driver works without setting up
hotplugging, you can add the "-u root" option to upsd, upsmon, and
drivers; this should allow you to follow the below
instructions. However, don't forget to set up the correct
permissions later!).

NOTE: If you are using something like udev or devd, make sure
these permissions stay set across a reboot.  If they revert to the
old values, your drivers may fail to start.


You are now ready to configure NUT, and start testing and using it.

You can jump directly to the <<Configuration_notes,NUT configuration>>.

[[Installing_inplace]]
Building NUT for in‐place upgrades or non‐disruptive tests
----------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The NUT GitHub Wiki article at
https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/wiki/Building-NUT-for-in%E2%80%90place-upgrades-or-non%E2%80%90disruptive-tests
may contain some more hints as contributed by the community.

Overview
~~~~~~~~

Since late 2022/early 2023 NUT codebase supports "in-place" builds
which try their best to discover the configuration of an earlier build
(configuration and run-time paths and OS accounts involved, maybe an
exact configuration if stored in deployed binaries).

This optional mode is primarily intended for several use-cases:

* Test recent GitHub "master" branch or a proposed PR to see if it
  solves a practical problem for a particular user;
* Replace an existing deployment, e.g. if OS-provided packages deliver
  obsolete code, to use newer NUT locally in "production mode".
  - In such cases ideally get your distribution, NAS vendor, etc.
    to provide current NUT -- and benefit from a better integrated
    and tested product.

Note that "just testing" often involves building the codebase and new
drivers or tools in question, and running them right from the build
workspace (without installing into the system and so risking an
unpredictable-stability state). In case of testing new driver builds,
note that you would need to stop the normally running instances to
free up the communications resources (USB/serial ports, etc.), run the
new driver program in data-dump mode, and restart the normal systems
operations.

Such tests still benefit from matching the build configuration to what
is already deployed, in order to request same configuration files and
system access permissions (e.g. to own device nodes for physical-media
ports involved, and to read the production configuration files).

Pre-requisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The {linkdoc}qa-guide{ld-s}[NUT Quality Assurance Guide,NUT_Config_Prereqs,docs/config-prereqs.txt]
document details tools and dependencies that were added on NUT CI build
environments, which now cover many operating systems. This should
provide a decent starting point for the build on yours (PRs to update
the document are welcome!)

Note that unlike distribution tarballs, Git sources do not include a
`configure` script and some other files -- these should be generated by
running `autogen.sh` (or `ci_build.sh` that calls it).

Getting the right sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To build the current tip of development iterations (usually after PR
merges that passed CI, reviews and/or other tests), just clone the NUT
repository and "master" branch should get checked out by default (also
can request that explicitly, per example posted below).

If you want to quickly test a particular pull request, see the link on
top of the PR page that says `... wants to merge ... from : ...` and
copy the proposed-source URL of that "from" part.

For example, in some PR this says `jimklimov:issue-1234` and links to
`https://github.com/jimklimov/nut/tree/issue-1234`.
For manual git-cloning, just paste that URL into the shell and replace
the `/tree/` with "`-b`" CLI option for branch selection; it also helps
to keep the workspace directory name dedicated to that PR, like this:

	:; cd /tmp
	### Checkout https://github.com/jimklimov/nut/tree/issue-1234
	:; git clone https://github.com/jimklimov/nut -b issue-1234 nut-issue-1234
	:; cd nut-issue-1234
	### OPTIONALLY fetch known git tags, so semantic versions look better
	:; git fetch --tags --all
	### Proceed with build (common instructions below)

Testing with CI helper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NOTE: This uses the `ci_build.sh` script to arrange some rituals and
settings, in this case primarily to default the choice of drivers to
auto-detection of what can be built, and to skip building documentation.
Also note that this script supports many other scenarios for CI and
developers, managed by `BUILD_TYPE` and other environment variables,
which are not explored here.

An "in-place" _testing_ build and run would probably go along these lines:

	:; cd /tmp
	:; git clone -b master https://github.com/networkupstools/nut
	:; cd nut
	### OPTIONALLY fetch known git tags, so semantic versions look better
	:; git fetch --tags --all
	### Proceed with build
	:; ./ci_build.sh inplace
	### Temporarily stop your original drivers
	:; ./drivers/nutdrv_qx -a DEVNAME_FROM_UPS_CONF -d1 -DDDDDD \
	    # -x override...=... -x subdriver=...
	### Can start back your original drivers
	### Analyze and/or post back the data-dump

[NOTE]
======
To probe a device for which you do not have an `ups.conf` section
yet, you must specify `-s name` and all config options (including
`port`) on command-line with `-x` arguments, e.g.:

	:; ./drivers/nutdrv_qx -s temp-ups \
	    -d1 -DDDDDD -x port=auto \
	    -x vendorid=... -x productid=... \
	    -x subdriver=...
======

Replacing a NUT deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While `ci_build.sh inplace` can be a viable option for preparation of
local builds, you may want to have precise control over `configure`
options (e.g. choice of required drivers, or enabled documentation).

A sound starting point would be to track down packaging recipes used by
your distribution (e.g.
link:https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/nut/blob/rawhide/f/nut.spec[RPM spec]
or
link:https://salsa.debian.org/debian/nut/-/blob/debian/debian/rules[DEB rules]
files, etc.) to detail the same paths if you intend to replace those,
and copy the parameters for `configure` script from there -- especially
if your system is not currently running NUT v2.8.1 or newer (which embeds
this information to facilitate in-place upgrade rebuilds).

Note that the primary focus of in-place automated configuration mode is
about critical run-time options, such as OS user accounts, configuration
location and state/PID paths, so it alone might not replace your driver
binaries that the package would put into an obscure location like
`/lib/nut`. It would however install init-scripts or systemd units that
would refer to new locations specified by the current build, so such old
binaries would just consume disk space but not run.

Replacing any NUT deployment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NOTE: For deployments on OSes with `systemd` see the next section.

This goes similar to usual build and install from Git:

	:; cd /tmp
	:; git clone https://github.com/networkupstools/nut
	:; cd nut
	### OPTIONALLY fetch known git tags, so semantic versions look better
	:; git fetch --tags --all
	### Proceed with build
	:; ./autogen.sh
	:; ./configure --enable-inplace-runtime # --maybe-some-other-options
	:; make -j 4 all && make -j 4 check && sudo make install

Note that `make install` does not currently handle all the nuances that
packaging installation scripts would, such as customizing filesystem
object ownership, daemon restarts, etc. or even creating locations like
`/var/state/ups` and `/var/run/nut` as part of the `make` target (but
e.g. the delivered `systemd-tmpfiles` configuration can handle that for
a large part of the audience). This aspect is tracked as
link:https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1298[issue #1298]

At this point you should revise the locations for PID files
(e.g. `/var/run/nut`) and pipe files (e.g. `/var/state/ups`) that they
exist and permissions remain suitable for NUT run-time user selected by
your configuration, and typically stop your original NUT drivers,
data-server (upsd) and upsmon, and restart them using the new binaries.

Replacing a systemd-enabled NUT deployment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For modern Linux distributions with `systemd` this replacement procedure
could be enhanced like below, to also re-enable services (creating proper
symlinks) and to get them started:

	:; cd /tmp
	:; git clone https://github.com/networkupstools/nut
	:; cd nut
	### OPTIONALLY fetch known git tags, so semantic versions look better
	:; git fetch --tags --all
	### Proceed with build
	:; ./autogen.sh
	:; ./configure --enable-inplace-runtime # --maybe-some-other-options
	:; make -j 4 all && make -j 4 check && \
	    { sudo systemctl stop nut-monitor nut-server || true ; } && \
	    { sudo systemctl stop nut-driver.service || true ; } && \
	    { sudo systemctl stop nut-driver.target || true ; } && \
	    { sudo systemctl stop nut.target || true ; } && \
	    sudo make install && \
	    sudo systemctl daemon-reload && \
	    sudo systemd-tmpfiles --create && \
	    sudo systemctl disable nut.target nut-driver.target \
	        nut-monitor nut-server nut-driver-enumerator.path \
	        nut-driver-enumerator.service && \
	    sudo systemctl enable nut.target nut-driver.target \
	        nut-monitor nut-server nut-driver-enumerator.path \
	        nut-driver-enumerator.service && \
	    { sudo systemctl restart udev || true ; } && \
	    sudo systemctl restart nut-driver-enumerator.service \
	        nut-monitor nut-server

Note the several attempts to stop old service units -- naming did change
from 2.7.4 and older releases, through 2.8.0, and up to current codebase.
Most of the NUT units are now `WantedBy=nut.target` (which is in turn
`WantedBy=multi-user.target` and so bound to system startup). You should
only `systemctl enable` those units you need on this system -- this allows
it to not start the daemons you do not need (e.g. not run `upsd` NUT data
server on systems which are only `upsmon secondary` clients).

The `nut-driver-enumerator` units (and corresponding shell script) are
part of a new feature introduced in NUT 2.8.0, which automatically
discovers `ups.conf` sections and changes to their contents, and manages
instances of a `nut-driver@.service` definition.

You may also have to restart (or reload if supported) some system services
if your updates impact them, like `udev` for updates USB support (note also
link:https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/pull/1342[PR #1342] regarding
the change from `udev.rules` to `udev.hwdb` file with NUT v2.8.0 or later --
you may have to remove the older file manually).

Iterating with a systemd deployment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are regularly building NUT from GitHub "master" branch, or iterating
local development branches of your own, you *may* get away with shorter
constructs to just restart the services after installing newly built files
(if you know there were no changes to unit file definitions and dependencies),
e.g.:

	:; cd /tmp
	:; git clone https://github.com/networkupstools/nut
	:; cd nut
	:; git checkout -b issue-1234 ### your PR branch name, arbitrary
	### OPTIONALLY fetch known git tags, so semantic versions look better
	:; git fetch --tags --all
	### Proceed with build
	:; ./autogen.sh
	:; ./configure --enable-inplace-runtime # --maybe-some-other-options
	### Iterate your code changes (e.g. PR draft), build and install with:
	:; make -j 4 all && make -j 4 check && \
	    sudo make install && \
	    sudo systemctl daemon-reload && \
	    sudo systemd-tmpfiles --create && \
	    sudo systemctl restart \
	        nut-driver-enumerator.service nut-monitor nut-server

Note that to contribute your work back to upstream NUT codebase, you would
need to create a "fork" of https://github.com/networkupstools/nut on GitHub,
then `git remote add USERNAME https://github.com/USERNAME/nut`, maybe refresh
the workspace index with `git fetch --all`, and finally `git push USERNAME`
(possibly follow further instructions from `git` tooling) to create the
pull request. For more details, see `docs/developers.txt` in NUT sources.

Next steps after an in-place upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can jump directly to the <<Configuration_notes,NUT configuration>>
if you need to revise the settings for your new NUT version, take advantage
of new configuration options, etc.

Check the {linksrcdoc}NEWS.adoc[] and {linksrcdoc}UPGRADING.adoc[] files
in your checked-out Git workspace to review features that should be present
in your new build.

[[Installing_packages]]
Installing from packages
------------------------

This chapter describes the specific installation steps when using
binary packages that exist on various major systems.

[[Debian]]
Debian, Ubuntu and other derivatives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NOTE: NUT is packaged and well maintained in these systems.
The official Debian packager used to be part of the NUT Team.

Using your preferred method (apt-get, aptitude, Synaptic, ...), install
the 'nut' package, and optionally the following:

- 'nut-cgi', if you need the CGI (HTML) option,
- 'nut-snmp', if you need the snmp-ups driver,
- 'nut-xml', for the netxml-ups driver,
- 'nut-powerman-pdu', to control the PowerMan daemon (PDU management)
- 'nut-dev', if you need the development files.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
- nut-client
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Configuration files are located in /etc/nut.
linkman:nut.conf[5] must be edited to be able to invoke /etc/init.d/nut

NOTE: Ubuntu users can access the APT URL installation by clicking
on link:apt://nut[this link].


[[Mandriva]]
Mandriva
~~~~~~~~

NOTE: NUT is packaged and well maintained in these systems.
The official Mandriva packager is part of the NUT Team.

Using your preferred method (urpmi, RPMdrake, ...), install one of the
two below packages:

- 'nut-server' if you have a 'standalone' or 'netserver' installation,
- 'nut' if you have a 'netclient' installation.

Optionally, you can also install the following:

- 'nut-cgi', if you need the CGI (HTML) option,
- 'nut-devel', if you need the development files.


[[SUSE]]
SUSE / openSUSE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NOTE: NUT is packaged and well maintained in these systems.
The official SUSE packager is part of the NUT Team.

Install the 'nut-classic' package, and optionally the following:

- 'nut-drivers-net', if you need the snmp-ups or the netxml-ups drivers,
- 'nut-cgi', if you need the CGI (HTML) option,
- 'nut-devel', if you need the development files,

NOTE: SUSE and openSUSE users can use the
link:http://software.opensuse.org/search?baseproject=ALL&p=1&q=nut[one-click install method]
to install NUT.


[[RedHat]]
Red Hat, Fedora and CentOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NOTE: NUT is packaged and well maintained in these systems.
The official Red Hat packager is part of the NUT Team.

Using your preferred method (yum, Add/Remove Software, ...), install
one of the two below packages:

- 'nut' if you have a 'standalone' or 'netserver' installation,
- 'nut-client' if you have a 'netclient' installation.

Optionally, you can also install the following:

- 'nut-cgi', if you need the CGI (HTML) option,
- 'nut-xml', if you need the netxml-ups driver,
- 'nut-devel', if you need the development files.


[[FreeBSD]]
FreeBSD
~~~~~~~

You can either install NUT as a binary package or as a port.

Binary package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install NUT as a package execute:

	# pkg install nut

Port
^^^^

The port is located under +sysutils/nut+.
Use +make config+ to select configuration options, e.g. to build the
optional CGI scripts.
To install it, use:

	# make install clean

USB UPS on FreeBSD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For USB UPS devices the NUT package/port installs devd rules in
+/usr/local/etc/devd/nut-usb.conf+ to set USB device permissions.
 'devd' needs to be restarted  for these rules to apply:

	# service devd restart

(Re-)connect the device after restarting 'devd' and check that the USB
device has the proper permissions. Check the last entries of the system
message buffer. You should find an entry like:

	# dmesg | tail
	[...]
	ugen0.2: <INNO TECH USB to Serial> at usbus0

The device file must be owned by group +uucp+ and must be group
read-/writable. In the example from above this would be

	# ls -Ll /dev/ugen0.2
	crw-rw----  1 root  uucp  0xa5 Mar 12 10:33 /dev/ugen0.2

If the permissions are not correct, verify that your device is registered in
+/usr/local/etc/devd/nut-usb.conf+. The vendor and product id can be found
using:

	# usbconfig -u 0 -a 2 dump_device_desc

where +-u+ specifies the USB bus number and +-a+ specifies the USB device
index.


[[Windows]]
Windows
~~~~~~~

Windows binary package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[NOTE]
======
NUT binary package built for Windows platform was last issued for
a much older codebase (using NUT v2.6.5 as a baseline). While the current
state of the codebase you are looking at aims to refresh the effort of
delivering NUT on Windows, the aim at the moment is to help developers
build and modernize it after a decade of blissful slumber, and packages
are not being regularly produced yet. Functionality of such builds varies
a lot depending on build environment used. This effort is generally
tracked at https://github.com/orgs/networkupstools/projects/2/views/1
and help would be welcome!

It should currently be possible to build the codebase in native Windows
with MSYS2/MinGW and cross-building from Linux with mingw (preferably
in a Debian/Ubuntu container). Refer to
link:docs/config-prereqs.txt[Prerequisites for building NUT on different OSes]
and link:scripts/Windows/README.adoc[scripts/Windows/README.adoc file]
for respective build environment preparation instructions.

Note that to use NUT for Windows, non-system dependency DLL files must
be located in same directory as each EXE file that uses them. This can be
accomplished for FOSS libraries (copying them from the build environment)
by calling `make install-win-bundle DESTDIR=/some/valid/location` easily.

Archives with binaries built by recent iterations of continuous integration
jobs should be available for exploration on the respective CI platforms.
======

*Information below may be currently obsolete, but the NUT project wishes
it to become actual and factual again :)*

NUT binary package built for Windows platform comes in a `.msi` file.

If you are using Windows 95, 98 or Me, you should install
link:http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=cebbacd8-c094-4255-b702-de3bb768148f&displaylang=en[Windows Installer 2.0]
from Microsoft site.

If you are using Windows 2000 or NT 4.0, you can
link:http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=4b6140f9-2d36-4977-8fa1-6f8a0f5dca8f&DisplayLang=en[download it here].

Newer Windows releases should include the Windows Installer natively.

Run `NUT-Installer.msi` and follow the wizard indications.

If you plan to use an UPS which is locally connected to an USB port,
you have to install
link:https://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb-win32/files/[libUSB-win32]
on your system. Then you must install your device via libusb's "Inf Wizard".

NOTE: If you intend to build from source, relevant sources may be available at
https://github.com/mcuee/libusb-win32 and keep in mind that it is a variant of
libusb-0.1. Current NUT supports libusb-1.0 as well, and that project should
have Windows support out of the box (but it was not explored for NUT yet).

If you have selected default directory, all configuration files are located in
`C:\Program Files\NUT\ups\etc`

Building for Windows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For suggestions about setting up the NUT build environment variants
for Windows, please see link:docs/config-prereqs.txt and/or
link:scripts/Windows/README.adoc files. Note this is rather experimental
at this point.

If using USB drivers, such as `usbhid-ups`, `nutdrv_qx` or `blazer_usb`,
you may benefit from the link:http://zadig.akeo.ie/[Zadig] tool to pin
the low-level drivers needed for LibUSB and further NUT to interact with
the hardware.  Otherwise, OS-provided (e.g. "HID Battery") or third-party
drivers may attach and "steal" bytes from the data stream needed by LibUSB
rendering it invalid.

NOTE: For more details, see
link:https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1690[NUT issue #1690] and
the link:https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/wiki/NUT-for-Windows[NUT for
Windows] article on NUT GitHub Wiki.

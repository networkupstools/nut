Description: The core system of the nut - Network UPS Tools
 nut is a client/server uninterruptible power supply (UPS) monitoring system
 that permits the sharing of one (or more) UPS between several machines. The
 'server' monitors the UPS and notifies the 'clients' when the UPS is on
 or has a low battery.
 .
 This package contains the core system. In many cases it is sufficient for
 a basic UPS monitoring system.

Description: A web interface sub system for the nut - Network UPS Tools
 nut is a client/server uninterruptible power supply (UPS) monitoring system
 that permits the sharing of one (or more) UPS between several machines. The
 'server' monitors the UPS and notifies the 'clients' when the UPS is on
 or has a low battery.
 .
 This package contains the web interface for Network UPS Tools. It adds
 http interface to the core nut system so that one is able to monitor 
 the core system with a web browser.

Description: A meta SNMP Driver subsystem for the nut - Network UPS Tools
 nut is a client/server uninterruptible power supply (UPS) monitoring system
 that permits the sharing of one (or more) UPS between several machines. The
 'server' monitors the UPS and notifies the 'clients' when the UPS is on
 or has a low battery.
 .
 This package contains snmp-ups, the Meta SNMP UPS Driver, which support
 different MIBS (IETF, MGE, APC) for Network UPS Tools. It adds an SNMP 
 Manager interface to the core system. You probably don't need it if
 you don't understand what this is all about.

Description: USB Drivers subsystem for NUT - Network UPS Tools
 nut is a client/server uninterruptible power supply (UPS) monitoring system
 that permits the sharing of one (or more) UPS between several machines. The
 'server' monitors the UPS and notifies the 'clients' when the UPS is on
 or has a low battery.
 .
 This package contains energizerups, megatec_usb, tripplite_usb and usbhid-ups,
 the USB UPS Drivers which support different Manufacturers (MGE, APC, ...) for
 Network UPS Tools.  These add a USB interface to the core system. You only
 need to install this package if you are connecting your UPS directly to
 this machine via a USB cable.  Other systems monitoring this UPS only need the
 core nut package to connect to this host via the network.

Description: Development files for NUT - Network UPS Tools
 nut is a client/server uninterruptible power supply (UPS) monitoring system
 that permits the sharing of one (or more) UPS between several machines. The
 'server' monitors the UPS and notifies the 'clients' when the UPS is on
 or has a low battery.
 .
 This package contains the development headers (upsclient.h and parseconf.h),
 library (static only, libupsclient.a) and testing driver (dummycons) for
 Network UPS Tools. These allows to compile client applications such as wmnut,
 and test their behavior. You probably don't need it if you don't understand
 what this is all about.

Description: HAL interface for NUT - Network UPS Tools
 nut is a client/server uninterruptible power supply (UPS) monitoring system
 that permits the sharing of one (or more) UPS between several machines. The
 'server' monitors the UPS and notifies the 'clients' when the UPS is on
 or has a low battery.
 .
 This package contains addons for the hardware abstraction layer (HAL) that
 allow desktop environments to monitor locally-connected UPS equipment. The
 HAL drivers cannot be used at the same time as the normal NUT upsd.

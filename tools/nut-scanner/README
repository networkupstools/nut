NUT device discovery
====================

Introduction
------------

linkman:nut-scanner[8] is available to discover supported NUT devices
(USB, SNMP, Eaton XML/HTTP and IPMI) and NUT servers (using Avahi or the
classic connection method).

This tool actually uses a library, called *libnutscan*, to perform actual
processing. The library is built with DMF support for SNMP device discovery,
when it can use loadable files that map MIB and other needed details to NUT
internals. If the client does not set relevant flags for loading DMF, or if
no data was successfully loaded, the library would fall back to using the
legacy static built-in structure with some mappings available in it.


Client access library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The nutscan library can be linked into other programs to give access
to NUT discovery. Both static and shared versions are provided.

linkman:nut-scanner[8] is provided as an example of how to use the nutscan
functions.

Here is a simple example that scans for USB devices, and use its own
iteration function to display results:

	#include <stdlib.h>
	#include <unistd.h>
	#include <string.h>

	/* Only enable USB scan */
	#define HAVE_USB_H

	#include "nut-scan.h"

	int main()
	{
		nutscan_options_t * opt;
		nutscan_device_t *device;

		nutscan-init();

		if ((device = nutscan_scan_usb()) == NULL) {
			printf("No device found\n");
			exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
		}

		/* Rewind the list */
		while(device->prev != NULL) {
			device = device->prev;
		}

		/* Print results */
		do {
			printf("USB device found\n\tdriver: \"%s\"\n\tport: \"%s\"\n",
				device->driver, device->port);

			/* process options (serial number, bus, ...) */
			opt = &(device->opt);
			do {
				if( opt->option != NULL ) {
					printf("\t%s",opt->option);
					if( opt->value != NULL ) {
						printf(": \"%s\"", opt->value);
					}
					printf("\n");
				}
				opt = opt->next;
			} while( opt != NULL );

			device = device->next;
		}
		while( device != NULL );

		exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
	}


This library file and the associated header files are not installed by
default.  You must `./configure --with-dev` to enable building and
installing these files. The libraries can then be built and installed
with `make` and `make install` as usual. This must be done before
building other (non-NUT) programs which depend on them.

For more information, refer to the linkman:nutscan[3],
manual page and the various
link:man/index.html#devscan[nutscan_*(3)] functions documentation
referenced in the same file.


Configuration helpers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NUT provides helper scripts to ease the configuration step of your program, by
detecting the right compilation and link flags.

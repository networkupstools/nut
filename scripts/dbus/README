This document introduces the DBus right rules for NUT.
It describes how upsd cn register names and paths on system bus and
how client can send requests to methods of objects.

Installation
------------

For most users, these files will be automatically installed in
/etc/dbus-1 upon "make install", if that directory exists and if
the feature (DBus) has been enabled at configure time. You can
specify an alternate directory with ./configure --with-dbus-dir=DIR.

Manual installation
-------------------

To install them manually, copy the rules file(s) to /etc/dbus-1/system.d
using the command(s):

$ cp -f nut-dbus.conf /etc/dbus-1/system.d/nut-dbus.conf

You will need to refresh the bus to avoid a reboot for these rules to be
active. You can do so using:

$ systemctl reload dbus.service

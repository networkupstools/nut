#  \brief   Enumerate NUT devices for service-unit instance configuration
#  \details This script allows to enumerate UPSes in order to produce the
#           individual service unit instances for each defined configuration.
#           It assumes the user has adequate permissions to inspect and create
#           services (e.g. is a root or has proper RBAC profiles to do so).
#           It helps service frameworks such as Linux systemd and Solaris SMF.
#           When executed, this script looks for all configured ups.conf
#           sections and registered service instances, and makes these two
#           lists match up. It has also a mode to do this in a loop, to keep
#           checking for differences and applying them, on systems where it's
#           problematic to trigger it in response to FS event notifications.
#           Returns exit codes:
#               0   Sections and services already match up
#               42  Sections and services differed, but now match up -
#                   now the caller should likely restart some services.
#                   Note that the drivers' service instances were started or
#                   stopped as required (by AUTO_START=yes) - but maybe the
#                   upsd or upsmon services should restart. If you pass envvar
#                   REPORT_RESTART_42=no then this codepath would return 0.
#                   In default mode, such non-null reconfiguration should cause
#                   the nut-driver-enumerator service to restart and this would
#                   propagate to other NUT services that depend on it.
#               13  Sections and services differed, and still do not match up
#               1   Bad inputs, e.g. unrecognized service management framework
#               2   Absent or unreadable ups.conf file
#

# NOTE: Currently found caveats that might be solved later but require
# considerable effort:
# * Solaris SMF constrains the syntax of valid strings for instance names
#   (e.g. not starting with a digit, no period chars) which blocks creation
#   of some UPS driver instances. This might be worked around by hashing
#   the device name e.g. to base64 (and un-hashing instance name when calling
#   upsdrvctl), but is not quite user-friendly. Also can store device name
#   in a service attribute while mangling the instance name to a valid subset.
#   Comparisons (if devices are already wrapped) becomes more complicated in
#   the script in either case, as well as in the service startup method.
# ** The `+` `/` `=` characters from base64 are also invalid for SMF instance
#    name, but the first two can be sed'ed to `-` `_`  and back, for example.
#    Some prefix word is also needed (avoid starting with a digit).
#    The trailing padding `=` can be dropped, and added until we get a
#    non-empty decode. Conversions can be done by
#    `echo "$string" | openssl base64 -e|-d`
# * Dummy-UPS services that "proxy" another locally defined section are
#   essentially a circular dependency for upsd. While the system might
#   start-up lacking a driver, there should be some timer to re-enable
#   failed not-disabled drivers (would be useful in any case though).

        Show configuration block of the specified NUT device
$0 --show-device-config-value DEV KEY [KEY...]
        Show single configuration key value of the specified NUT device
        For flags, shows the flag name if present in the section
        If several keys or flags are requested, their values are reported
        one per line in the same order (including empty lines for missing

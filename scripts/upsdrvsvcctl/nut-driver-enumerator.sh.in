#  \brief   Enumerate NUT devices for service-unit instance configuration
#  \details This script allows to enumerate UPSes in order to produce the
#           individual service unit instances for each defined configuration.
#           It assumes the user has adequate permissions to inspect and create
#           services (e.g. is a root or has proper RBAC profiles to do so).
#           It helps service frameworks such as Linux systemd and Solaris SMF.
#           When executed, this script looks for all configured ups.conf
#           sections and registered service instances, and makes these two
#           lists match up. It has also a mode to do this in a loop, to keep
#           checking for differences and applying them, on systems where it's
#           problematic to trigger it in response to FS event notifications.
#           Returns exit codes:
#               0   Sections and services already match up
#               42  Sections and services differed, but now match up -
#                   now the caller should likely restart some services.
#                   Note that the drivers' service instances were started or
#                   stopped as required (by AUTO_START=yes) - but maybe the
#                   upsd or upsmon services should restart. If you pass envvar
#                   REPORT_RESTART_42=no then this codepath would return 0.
#                   In default mode, such non-null reconfiguration should cause
#                   the nut-driver-enumerator service to restart and this would
#                   propagate to other NUT services that depend on it.
#               13  Sections and services differed, and still do not match up
#               1   Bad inputs, e.g. unrecognized service management framework
#               2   Absent or unreadable ups.conf file
#

# NOTE: Currently found caveats that might be solved later but require
# considerable effort:
# * Solaris SMF constrains the syntax of valid strings for instance names
#   (e.g. not starting with a digit, no period chars) which blocks creation
#   of some UPS driver instances. This might be worked around by hashing
#   the device name e.g. to base64 (and un-hashing instance name when calling
#   upsdrvctl), but is not quite user-friendly. Also can store device name
#   in a service attribute while mangling the instance name to a valid subset.
#   Comparisons (if devices are already wrapped) becomes more complicated in
#   the script in either case, as well as in the service startup method.
# ** The `+` `/` `=` characters from base64 are also invalid for SMF instance
#    name, but the first two can be sed'ed to `-` `_`  and back, for example.
#    Some prefix word is also needed (avoid starting with a digit).
#    The trailing padding `=` can be dropped, and added until we get a
#    non-empty decode. Conversions can be done by
#    `echo "$string" | openssl base64 -e|-d`
# * Dummy-UPS services that "proxy" another locally defined section are
#   essentially a circular dependency for upsd. While the system might
#   start-up lacking a driver, there should be some timer to re-enable
#   failed not-disabled drivers (would be useful in any case though).

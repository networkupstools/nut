Network UPS Tools - UPS driver controller ${PACKAGE_VERSION}
Starts and stops UPS drivers via system service instances, see
the $ENUMERATOR
script for more details.

usage: $0 [OPTIONS] (start | stop | shutdown) [<ups>]

Options:
  -h            	display this help
  -t            	testing mode - prints actions without doing them
  -D            	raise debugging level
  start         	start all UPS drivers in ups.conf
  start <ups>   	only start driver for UPS <ups>
  stop          	stop all UPS drivers in ups.conf
  stop <ups>    	only stop driver for UPS <ups>

Note: the "shutdown" options from original upsdrvctl are not currently
directly supported by this service management framework wrapper; instead
they are passed to the native upsdrvctl binary (your current user account
should have sufficient permissions to do that all):
  shutdown      	shutdown all UPS drivers in ups.conf
  shutdown <ups>	only shutdown UPS <ups>

usage: $0 [OPTIONS] resync
  resync        	call $ENUMERATOR
                	to update the mapping of service instances for
                	NUT drivers to device sections in 'ups.conf'

usage: $0 [OPTIONS] reconfigure
  reconfigure   	call $ENUMERATOR
                	to remove and re-create the mapping of all service
                	instances for NUT drivers to device sections in
                	'ups.conf' e.g. after a NUT package upgrade

usage: $0 [OPTIONS] list [<ups>]
  list          	call $ENUMERATOR
                	to list the mapping of service instances to device sections
  list <ups>    	(optionally return the service instance name for one device)

usage: $0 [OPTIONS] show-config [<ups>]
  show-config <ups>	output config section from ups.conf for device <ups>
  show-config   	...or all devices if no <ups> argument was passed

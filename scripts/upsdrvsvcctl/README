This directory contains the shared NUT support files for Linux systemd (the
System and Service Manager) and Solaris SMF (Service Management Framework).
It includes the nut-driver-enumerator.sh (service and implementation method)
and upsdrvsvcctl (tool) to manage NUT drivers as service instances.

These files are automatically installed into SBINDIR/upsdrvsvcctl and
LIBEXECDIR/nut-driver-enumerator.sh, upon detection (at configure time)
of a systemd or SMF enabled system, with Makefiles of the ../systemd/ and
../Solaris/ source directories respectively.

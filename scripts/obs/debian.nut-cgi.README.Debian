Network UPS Tools - CGI Interface - Quick Start for Debian
----------------------------------------------------------

(I) Installation
=================

1) Sample configuration files are provided in /etc/nut/
Rename without the ".sample" suffix the files hosts.conf, upsstats.html,
upsstats-single.html and optionaly upsset.conf.
Then edit these to match your configuration.

2) Ensure these configuration files are readable by others

      chmod 755 /etc/nut
      chmod 644 /etc/nut/upsset.conf
      chmod 644 /etc/nut/hosts.conf
      chmod 644 /etc/nut/upsstats.html
      chmod 644 /etc/nut/upsstats-single.html

3) You will then be able to access NUT CGI through a Web browser.
The URL, which depends on your httpd configuration, is:

      http://localhost/cgi-bin/nut/upsstats.cgi

4) NUT also provides a set of HTML files to wrap the CGIs.
To use it, create a new virtual host with your preferred webserver, and point the
Document Root to: /usr/share/nut/www/

	You can also add an alias to an existing site, if it is supported:
    Alias /nut/ "/usr/share/nut/www/"
 
	Also ensure that the files in this directory have the suitable permissions.

For more information on nut-cgi configuration, have a look at the following
manual pages:
- upsstats.html (5)
- hosts.conf (5)
- upsset.conf (5)

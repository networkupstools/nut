- how to distribute the nut-scanner and its library? Ie, a single package,
  or using the nut-{xml,snmp,...} packages.
  this requires libusb (0.1), Net SNMP, FreeIPMi, Avahi, libupsclient and Neon!
- consider an SSL/TLS set of packages (ie nut-ssl, ...)
  or help the port to NSS
- install the device-recorder.sh script (with libupsclient-dev or a more
  generic nut-dev that depends?)
- address the /var/www issue with upstream
- audit and solve the lintian reports...

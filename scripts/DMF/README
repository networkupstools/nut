# DMF - Device Mapping File

## Abstract

The aim is to develop a solution allowing to add new NUT SNMP (only, right now)
MIBs mappings without recompiling the binary driver (snmp-ups) or the whole NUT
source. The present solution is a first iteration to read these information from
external file (XML formatted), along with being able to convert existing C
implementations to such external files.

## XML spec

There are *4* main structures
 * info_lkp_t: mapping between NUT and SNMP values for a variable
 * alarms_info_t: mapping between NUT and SNMP *ups.alarm* values for a variable
 * snmp_info_t: mapping between NUT variables and SNMP OIDs
 * mib2nut_info_t: declaration of discovery and mapping (snmp_info_t)
   information

### LOOKUP

<nut>
    <lookup name="ats_output_status_info">
        <item oid = "1" info = "OFF" />
    </lookup>
</nut>

## Tools

 * jsonify-mib.py - print mib mapping to stdout

## jsonify-mib.py

Tool parses -mib.c files (snmp_info_t and info_lkp_t) and prints the output of
those as JSON. Note this is NOT intended as final DMF form, this json is
intermediate form for easier processing.

You need pycparser installed
    via your package management

or using pip
    virtualenv dmf
    source dmf/bin/activate
    pip install -e pycparser

Usage is then

    python jsonify-mib.py ../../drivers/apc-ats-mib.c
    {
        "INFO": {
            "ats_output_status_info": {
                "1": "OFF",
                "2": "OL"
            },
            "ats_sensitivity_info": {
                "1": "high",
                "2": "low"
            },
    ...

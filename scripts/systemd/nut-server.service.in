Description=Network UPS Tools - power devices information server
After=local-fs.target network.target nut-driver.target
# We don't Require drivers to be successfully started! This would be
# a change of behavior compared to init SysV, and could prevent from
# accessing successfully started, at least to audit a system.
Wants=nut-driver.target
# The `upsd` is a networked service (even if bound to a `localhost`)
# so it requires that the OS has some notion of networking already.
# Extending the unit does not require *this* file to be edited, you
# can instead drop in an additional piece of configuration, e.g. add
# a `/etc/systemd/system/nut-server.service.d/network.conf` with:
#   [Unit]
#   Requires=network-online.target
#   After=network-online.target

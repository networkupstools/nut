This directory contains the NUT support files for systemd, the System and
Service Manager.

These files are automatically installed, upon detection (at configure time)
of a systemd enabled system.

This also uses the nut-driver-enumerator.sh (service and implementation
method) and upsdrvsvcctl (tool) to manage NUT drivers as service instances
located in ../upsdrvsvcctl/ source subdirectory.

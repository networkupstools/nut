#  \brief   Enumerate NUT devices for service-unit instance configuration
#  \details This script allows to enumerate UPSes in order to produce the
#           individual service unit instances for each defined configuration.
#           It assumes the user has adequate permissions to inspect and create
#           services (e.g. is a root or has proper RBAC profiles to do so).
#           It helps service frameworks such as Linux systemd and Solaris SMF.
#           When executed, this script looks for all configured ups.conf
#           sections and registered service instances, and makes these two
#           lists match up. No arguments ATM. Returns exit codes:
#               0   Sections and services already match up
#               42  Sections and services differed, but now match up -
#                   now the caller should likely restart some services.
#                   Note that the drivers' service instances were started or
#                   stopped as required (by AUTO_START=yes) - but maybe the
#                   upsd or upsmon services should restart.
#               13  Sections and services differed, and still do not match up
#               1   Bad inputs, e.g. unrecognized service management framework
#               2   Absent or unreadable ups.conf file
#  \todo    Complete the sample basic support for Solaris SMF (needs support
#           for the service definitions similar to systemd NUT units to be
#           added to that platform first). Parts in this script are finished.

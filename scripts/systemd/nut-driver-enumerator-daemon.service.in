[Unit]
# This unit starts early in system lifecycle to set up nut-driver instances
# and stays running as a loop to pick up any subsequent changes maybe more
# reliably than the filesystem notification processing would allow.
# End-user may also restart this unit after editing ups.conf to automatically
# un-register or add new instances as appropriate.

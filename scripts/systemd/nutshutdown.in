# Network UPS Tools (NUT) systemd-shutdown integration handler.

# NOTE: This script requires both nut-server package (or more specifically,
# the drivers for your device, which may be in further packages grouped
# by media/protocol and third-party dependencies), nut-client (upsmon),
# and their configuration files to be present locally and on still-mounted
# filesystems (may be read-only).

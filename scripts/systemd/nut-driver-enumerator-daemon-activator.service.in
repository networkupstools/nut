[Unit]
# This unit starts via nut-driver-enumerator-daemon-activator.path
# activation due to changes in ups.conf file, and triggers a reload
# of the nut-driver-enumerator-daemon.service so that one quickly
# re-processes the new configuration state.
# NOTE: This unit is intentionally not installed as PartOf/WantedBy
# anything, as it is only meant to be triggered by the path unit.

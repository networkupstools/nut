[Unit]
# This unit starts via nut-driver-enumerator-daemon-activator.path
# activation due to changes in ups.conf file, and triggers a reload
# of the nut-driver-enumerator-daemon.service so that one quickly
# re-processes the new configuration state.
# NOTE: This unit is intentionally not installed as PartOf/WantedBy
# anything, as it is only meant to be triggered by the path unit.

[Service]
### Script needs privileges to restart units
#User=@RUN_AS_USER@
#Group=@RUN_AS_GROUP@
User=root
Type=oneshot
# Non-blocking systemd message posting should not take long,
# or should be aborted and retried if it does (system bugs)
TimeoutStartSec=10s
# If some process is writing the ups.conf file, it can be interpreted in
# some conditions by .path unit as many events requiring it to start -
# and eventually this gets throttled as a quickly started-restarted unit.
# While it should be permitted for manual start (likely .path trigger too)
# after interval expiration, this might race-condition to not detect some
# latest update into the configuration file if it happens after the main
# script loop has slurped intermediate state of device config.
# Note: Using the older but still supported Service/StartLimitInterval
# see https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/systemd-devel/2017-July/039255.html
# for broader compatibility.

# it is expected that the process has to exit before systemd starts follow-up
# units; it should not be a problem for those
Type=oneshot
# Currently systemd does not support restarting of oneshot services, and does
# not seem to guarantee that other services would only start after the script
# completes, for a non-oneshot case. The script itself handles restarting of
# nut-server which is the primary concerned dependency at the moment, so we
# don't want it to fail the unit (when it can't restart).

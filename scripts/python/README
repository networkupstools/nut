Python NUT Client files
-----------------------

This directory contains various NUT Client related Python scripts, written by
David Goncalves, and released under GPL v3.

* "module": this directory contains PyNUT.py, which is a Python abstraction
class to access NUT server(s). You can use it in Python programs to access NUT's
upsd data server in a simple way, without having to know the NUT protocol.
The same module should work for Python 2 and Python 3.

To import it on Python programs you have to use the following (case sensitive) :
'import PyNUT'

This module provides a 'PyNUTClient' class that can be used to connect and get
data from an upsd data server.

To install the PyNUT module on Debian/Ubuntu, copy it to:
/usr/share/python-support/python-pynut/

For quick tests, just make sure its directory is exported in `PYTHONPATH`
environment variable.

This directory also contains test_nutclient.py, which is a PyNUT test program.
For this to be fully functional, you will need to adapt the login, password and
upsname to fit your configuration. A NUT data server should be running for the
test program to verify connection and protocol support.


* "app": this directory contains the NUT-Monitor application, that uses the
PyNUT class, along with its resources.

To install it, you will either need to keep the files together, or to install:
- Depending on the Python version(s) your system has, put NUT-Monitor-py2gtk2
  or NUT-Monitor-py3qt5 to /usr/bin/, /usr/X11R6/bin/ or something like that
  (optionally making a simple NUT-Monitor symlink to the preferred version),
- ui/*.glade (for NUT-Monitor-py2gtk2) or ui/*.ui (for NUT-Monitor-py3qt5)
  to /usr/share/nut-monitor/,
- nut-monitor.png to something like /usr/share/pixmaps/
- finally, nut-monitor-py2gtk2.desktop and/or nut-monitor-py3qt5.desktop
  (optionally symlinked as nut-monitor.desktop) to /usr/share/applications/

Introduction
============

The project was originally started in 2008 David Goncalves <david@lestat.st>
at https://www.lestat.st/informatique/projets/pynut and was soon added
to the main NUT codebase and evolved there.

The PyNUT module provides an abstraction class `PyNUTClient` written in
Python, which allows to connect to a NUT (Network UPS Tools) server and
execute different commands without an application developer needing to
know the NUT communication protocol.

That class was born from another project the original author had -- a
graphical application to monitor and manage the UPSes connected to a
NUT server. It is now known as `NUT-Monitor` and is also provided along
with NT sources.

With that GUI application being written in Python too, it was decided
to split the project in two parts (the PyNUT class + GUI application,
serving as model + view) in order to keep the two parts independent.
That class was subsequently renamed to `PyNUTClient` since version 1.1
of the original project, allowing to develop other classes nearby later.

Currently the module is regularly tested to work with Python interpreter
versions 2.7, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.7.

[NOTE]
======
Text fields (including NUT protocol error codes quoted into `PyNUTError`
exceptions) returned by methods are byte sequences (not locale-aware
strings). This is of little concern for Python 2, but is important in
Python 3.

The `ups` argument to methods is handled as a string, so conversion may
be needed to compare with names returned in the arrays, e.g.:
----
strUps = bUps.decode('ascii')
bUps = strUps.encode('ascii')
----

Names returned by `GetUPSNames()` are specifically converted into string
type.

Since Python 3 support was added just recently, module code may later be
converted to use string types like `str` or `unicode` in the returned
dictionaries and sets instead, if the community deems this to be more
idiomatic.

Examples below *do not* specify the `b'some text'` markup that would be
pedantically correct (for Python 3 at least).

class PyNUTClient :
  def __init__( self, host='127.0.0.1', port=3493,
    login=None, password=None, debug=False, timeout=5 ) :

  def help( self ) :

  def ver( self ) :

  def DeviceLogin( self, ups="" ) :

  def FSD( self, ups="" ) :

  def GetRWVars( self, ups='' ) :

  def GetUPSCommands( self, ups='' ) :

  def GetUPSList( self ) :

  def GetUPSVars( self, ups='' ) :

  def ListClients( self, ups = None ) :

  def RunUPSCommand( self, ups='', command='' ) :

  def SetRWVar( self, ups='', var='', value='' ) :

The module also provides the `PyNUTError` class to represent any excpetions
raised by `PyNUTClient` logic.

Documentation
-------------

Although the original project was written in French, for the reasons of general
distribution with NUT, all of its code is commented in English. While this file
contains the description from https://www.lestat.st/informatique/projets/pynut
the class `PyNUTClient` is compatible with the Python module PyDOC, so you can
type `pydoc PyNUT` to obtain succint documentation on your current version of
the module.

For more examples see the provided test script and the NUT-Monitor application
in the NUT sources.

Commands below are listed in alphabetic order.

__init__
~~~~~~~~

When you initialize the class instance, it performs the connection to the NUT
data server or raises a Python exception from the `__connect()` method called
internally.


help
~~~~

Sends the `HELP` command to the NUT data server and returns whatever bits of
wizdom it has to offer.


ver
~~~

Sends the `VER` command to the NUT data server and returns its self-reported
identification such as version, product or distribution it may be bunded with.

Note that the NUT client interactions should not rely on reported versions,
but follow the protocol as defined.


DeviceLogin
~~~~~~~~~~~

Establish a "client" session with the specified UPS. This uses credentials
specified earlier to `__init__()` this class instance, and on server side
(in `upsd.users` file) these credentials must have one of `upsmon` roles.

The command should return `OK` if everything went well, or raise an exception
in case of failure, such as invalid or insufficiently privileged credentials.

Note there is no `DeviceLogout()`, just the general connection termination.


FSD
~~~

Send the FSD (Forced ShutDown) command to the specified UPS.

The command should return `OK` if everything went well, or raise an exception
in case of failure, such as that this server does not allow to manage that UPS
as a "primary" (or "master" before NUT 2.8.0).


GetRWVars
~~~~~~~~~

Returns a list of modifiable variables on the specified UPS, as a dictionary
of "variable"-"current value" pairs.

.Example
-----
    import PyNUT

    ups    = PyNUT.PyNUTClient( host='serveur', login='upsadmin', password='upspass' )
    result = ups.GetRWVars( ups='ups1' )
    print( result )

    >> {'battery.date': '10/25/07', 'ups.id': 'test'}
-----

See also: `GetUPSVars()`, `SetRWVar()`


GetUPSCommands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns a list of commands supported by the specified UPS.

Note that certain commands are not usable without first getting necessary
rights on the NUT data server.

The result is presented as a dictionary of "command"-"English description"
pairs.

.Example
-----
    import PyNUT

    ups    = PyNUT.PyNUTClient( host='serveur', login='upsadmin', password='upspass' )
    result = ups.GetRWVars( ups='ups1' )
    print( result )

    >> {'test.battery.start' : 'Start a battery test',
        'calibrate.stop'     : 'Stop run time calibration',
        'shutdown.stayoff'   : 'Turn off the load and remain off',
        'test.battery.stop'  : 'Stop the battery test',
        'test.panel.start'   : 'Start testing the UPS panel',
        'calibrate.start'    : 'Start run time calibration',
        'load.off'           : 'Turn off the load immediately',
        'test.failure.start' : 'Start a simulated power failure',
        'shutdown.return'    : 'Turn off the load and return when power is back'}

"name"-"description" pairs.

.Example
-----
    import PyNUT

    ups    = PyNUT.PyNUTClient( host='serveur', login='upsadmin', password='upspass' )
    result = ups.GetUPSList()
    print( result )

    >> {'UPS1': 'Smart UPS 3000 File server',
        'UPS2': 'Smart UPS 1000 Serveur de mail'}
-----


GetUPSVars
~~~~~~~~~~

Returns a list of all variables on the specified UPS, as a dictionary
of "variable"-"current value" pairs.

.Example
-----
    import PyNUT

    ups    = PyNUT.PyNUTClient( host='serveur', login='upsadmin', password='upspass' )
    result = ups.GetUPSVars( ups='UPS1' )
    print( result )

ListClients
~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns the list of connected clients (such as the `NUT-Monitor` application
or an `upsmon` service) from the NUT server, for a particular UPS or all of
them by default.

The result is a dictionary containing "upsname"-"client list" pairing 'UPSName'
and a list of clients for each device if the information was retrieved from
the NUT data server successfully, or an exception is raised otherwise.


RunUPSCommand
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Executes the specified command on the specified UPS. It should be one of the
commands returned by the `GetUPSCommands()` function.

Note that certain commands are not usable without first getting necessary
rights on the NUT data server.

The command should return `OK` if everything went well, or raise an exception
in case of failure.

.Example
-----
    import PyNUT

    ups    = PyNUT.PyNUTClient( host='serveur', login='upsadmin', password='upspass' )
    result = ups.RunUPSCommand( ups='UPS1', command='test.panel.start' )
    print( result )

    >> OK
-----

SetRWVar
~~~~~~~~

This method adjusts the value of a writable NUT variable on the specified UPS.
It should be one of the variables listed by the `GetRWVars()` method.

Note that you may need to first get necessary rights on the NUT data server.

The command should return `OK` if everything went well, or raise an exception
in case of failure.

.Example
-----
    import PyNUT

    ups    = PyNUT.PyNUTClient( host='serveur', login='upsadmin', password='upspass' )
    result = ups.SetRWVar( ups='UPS1', var='battery.date', value='06/17/08' )
    print( result )

    >> OK

This directory contains init-scripts and SMF manifests and methods
for integration of NUT services with Solaris and descendant OSes.

This also includes the nut-driver-enumerator.sh (service and implementation
method) and upsdrvsvcctl (tool) to manage NUT drivers as service instances,
which are stored in `../systemd/` subdirectory (portable codebase shared
with Linux systemd).

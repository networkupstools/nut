NUT and MS Windows
==================

Introduction
------------

NUT is now also available for the Microsoft Windows platform.

This methodology (and Windows support in general) are currently experimental,
so pull requests are welcome to tie up some loose ends (add more prerequisites,
test and fix programs, re-enable some code just commented away by `ifdef`s...)

NOTE: It is possible to prepare a Windows machine with tools and prerequisites
for building NUT natively, as detailed in `docs/config-prereqs.txt` and easily
handled by NUT common `ci_build.sh` script. Most prerequisites are already
packaged in that environment, but notably net-snmp is missing -- but can be
built from source following this document. Possibly, the instructions below
would converge there over time to keep it simple.

For additional reference about prerequisite preparation and further ideas for
the NUT for Windows effort, please see detailed report in the mailing list:

Cross compiling from Linux
--------------------------

Fortunately, you are not forced to have a real Windows system to compile NUT.
The following chapters will guide you through setting up up a
link:http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net[MinGW-w64] build environment and
compiling NUT.

NOTE: These instructions were re-verified (and codebase slightly amended)
with an Ubuntu 21.10 container as the dedicated build environment.
Support was added to NUT common `ci_build.sh` script to call the helper
`build-mingw-nut.sh` from this directory when cross-building on Linux
for Windows in the specially crafted sandbox (conformance is assumed),
if you use one of `BUILD_TYPE=cross-windows-mingw(-64|-32|)` as this
made NUT CI farm integration easier.

NOTE: The Ubuntu (20.04 or newer) environment provided by WSL2 also seems
suitable for semi-native builds on a Windows system, following the same
instructions. However, note that some builds may be broken or complicated
by antivirus software (it really dislikes someone writing into EXE files).

Beside MinGW detailed below, you would need the usual dependencies to
configure and build NUT (if you would bootstrap it from github sources
rather than a tarball -- without a pre-generated `configure` script).
Notably, `asciidoc` with its many dependencies may be required for
generation of man pages into the intermediate tarball used by script
referenced below.

MinGW-w64 build environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will first need to setup a MinGW-w64 build environment.

NOTE: While adding `ccache` is optional, it is quite recommended especially
if you plan to iterate many builds (whether of NUT or the dependencies).
At least for Ubuntu 21.10 packaging, it is integrated with `mingw-w64`
tool naming out of the box.

On Debian/Ubuntu and similar systems, use:

	# apt-get update
	# apt-get install mingw-w64

On Redhat and similar systems, use:

	# ???

You will also need pthread and mingw regex libraries, and other recommended
dependencies as detailed below.

[NOTE]
================================================================================

If you use script `./build-mingw-nut.sh` mentioned below, you may skip setting
these environment variables when building NUT. You would however need to use
them once (per `ARCH`) to provide the prerequisites below if built from source.

When using the compilation approach, use the following HOST_FLAG, BUILD_FLAG
and CC, CFLAGS, LDFLAGS and PREFIX:

- prefer either to
------
:; export ARCH="x86_64-w64-mingw32"
------
or
------
:; export ARCH="i686-w64-mingw32"
------
(it can help to open two terminals and copy one ARCH into each
  and then the lines below into both of them; be sure to use separate
  directory trees for the unpacked build workspaces)

- for either-ARCH build environment further set:
------
:; export HOST_FLAG="--host=$ARCH"
:; PREFIX="/usr/$ARCH"
------

- NOTE: Technically, these instructions may apply to builds with MinGW on
  Windows semi-natively (e.g. to add the net-snmp libraries which are not
  packaged for MSYS2 MinGW currently). Generally you can use environment
  variables set by different launchers of MinGW terminal sessions depending
  on the target profile (32/64 bit, gcc/clang, libc implementation...)

** For `sudo make install` in instructions below, you may have to omit the
   `sudo` part if missing in your MSYS2 MinGW environment;

** For a "native build" directly for consumption in the currently configured
   environment, you would not use cross-build path in `PREFIX` and not set
   the `HOST_FLAG` value:
+
------
:; export ARCH="$MINGW_CHOST"
:; PREFIX="$MINGW_PREFIX"
:; export HOST_FLAG=""
------

** If you wanted a "real cross-build" for a different MinGW environment, you
   might want to set those (but the NUT build would then need to be told to
   search for headers, libraries and pkg-config data in extra locations):
+
------
:; export ARCH="$MINGW_CHOST"
:; PREFIX="$MINGW_PREFIX/$ARCH"
:; export HOST_FLAG="--host=$ARCH"
------
** You might want then to verify that it sets values you expect with a command
   like this:
+
------
:; set | grep -E '^(ARCH|PREFIX|HOST_FLAG)='
#export ARCH="x86_64-w64-mingw32"
#PREFIX="/mingw64/x86_64-w64-mingw32"
------

- on Debian/Ubuntu style systems also:
------
:; BUILD_FLAG="--build=`dpkg-architecture -qDEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE`"
------
  * Note that this bit is very Debian specific!
    Hints for Redhat-style systems are wanted.

- also export the following compilation flags:
------
:; export CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -D_POSIX=1 -I${PREFIX}/include/"
:; export CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -D_POSIX=1 -I${PREFIX}/include/"
:; export LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -L${PREFIX}/lib/"
:; export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="${PREFIX}"/lib/pkgconfig
------

- prepare the download and build area, e.g. to match copy-paste instructions
below, it would be like:
------
:; DLDIR=~/nut-win-deps
:; WSDIR="$DLDIR"/"$ARCH"
:; mkdir -p "$WSDIR" "$DLDIR"
------

================================================================================


pthread library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NOTE: The MinGW distribution in Ubuntu 21.10 already includes pthread files,
so the build instructions below were not relevant for this component.

On older Debian systems, you can use the following packages repository:
link:https://launchpad.net/~mingw-packages/+archive/ppa[MinGW PPA]

However at the moment this PPA seems to be stale and serve very old packages,
so it could be better to roll your own as detailed below.

On Redhat: FIXME

https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:MinGW?rd=Packaging:MinGW_Future
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:MinGW_Old
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

You can also compile it (where that is still needed) using:

	:; ( cd "$DLDIR" && wget -c http://mirrors.kernel.org/sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32/pthreads-w32-2-8-0-release.tar.gz )
	:; cd "$WSDIR"

	:; sudo cp *.dll ${PREFIX}/pthreads/lib/
	:; sudo cp *.a ${PREFIX}/lib/
	:; sudo cp pthread.h sched.h semaphore.h ${PREFIX}/pthreads/include


MinGW regex library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can compile it  using:

	:; ( cd "$DLDIR" && wget -c http://netcologne.dl.sourceforge.net/project/mingw/Other/UserContributed/regex/mingw-regex-2.5.1/mingw-libgnurx-2.5.1-src.tar.gz )

	:; cd mingw-libgnurx-2.5.1
	:; ./configure --prefix="$PREFIX" $HOST_FLAG
	:; make
	:; sudo make install


libtool (libltdl)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	:; ( cd "$DLDIR" && wget -c https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/libtool/libtool-2.4.6.tar.gz )
	:; cd "$WSDIR"
	:; tar xzf "$DLDIR"/libtool-2.4.6.tar.gz
	:; cd libtool-2.4.6
	:; ./configure --prefix="$PREFIX" $HOST_FLAG
	:; make
	:; sudo make install


libusb
^^^^^^

* libusb-1.0

	:; ( cd "$DLDIR" && wget -c https://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb/files/libusb-1.0/libusb-1.0.26/libusb-1.0.26.tar.bz2 )
	:; cd "$WSDIR"

	:; cd libusb-1.0.26
	:; ./configure --prefix="$PREFIX" $HOST_FLAG
	:; make
	:; sudo make install

* libusb-compat-0.1 (API translation layer for older codebase, uses libusb-1.0)

	:; ( cd "$DLDIR" && wget -c https://github.com/libusb/libusb-compat-0.1/archive/refs/heads/master.zip -O libusb-compat-0.1-master.zip )
	:; cd "$WSDIR"
	:; unzip "$DLDIR"/libusb-compat-0.1-master.zip
	:; cd libusb-compat-0.1-master
	:; ./bootstrap.sh
	:; ./configure --prefix="$PREFIX" $HOST_FLAG
	:; make
	:; sudo make install


zlib
^^^^

Needed for libpng at least, but likely many others too.

[NOTE]
======
On recent Debian/Ubuntu systems, you might have luck with:
------
:; sudo apt-get install libz-mingw-w64-dev
------
======

On any system, you can build from source; however the current version has
a nuance to address for mingw builds:

	:; ( cd "$DLDIR" && wget -c -O zlib-1.2.12.tar.gz https://github.com/madler/zlib/archive/refs/tags/v1.2.12.tar.gz )
	:; cd "$WSDIR"
	:; tar xzf "$DLDIR"/zlib-1.2.12.tar.gz
	:; cd zlib-1.2.12

	# Edit the `configure` script (not autotools generated) to
	# neuter the MINGW `leave 1` line:
	  MINGW* | mingw*)
	# temporary bypass
	        rm -f $test.[co] $test $test$shared_ext
	        echo "Please use win32/Makefile.gcc instead." | tee -a configure.log
	-       leave 1
	+       ###leave 1
	        LDSHARED=${LDSHARED-"$cc -shared"}
	        LDSHAREDLIBC=""
	        EXE='.exe' ;;

	:; CHOST="$ARCH" ./configure --prefix="$PREFIX"
	:; make
	:; sudo make install


openssl
^^^^^^^

OpenSSL is an optional dependency for NUT itself (it or Mozilla NSS can
be used to protect the networking communications), and for libneon below
(OpenSSL or GnuTLS).

Note the non-standard `config` script bundled along, and hoops to jump
through...

	:; ( cd "$DLDIR" && wget -c https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.1.1q.tar.gz )
	:; cd "$WSDIR"
	:; tar xzf "$DLDIR"/openssl-1.1.1q.tar.gz
	:; cd openssl-1.1.1q
	# Build options partially lifted from OBS packaging, see:
	# https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/windows:mingw:win32/mingw32-openssl-1_1/mingw32-openssl-1_1.spec?expand=1
	:; ( case "$ARCH" in
	     *x86_64*) SYSTEM=MINGW64 ;;
	     *i?86*) SYSTEM=MINGW32 ;;
	     *) SYSTEM=MINGW ;;
	     esac
	     export SYSTEM
	     ./config \
	        no-idea enable-rfc3779 zlib shared \
	        -fno-common \
	        --prefix="$PREFIX" --cross-compile-prefix="/usr/bin/$ARCH-" \
	        -DPURIFY -D__USE_GNU
	   )
	:; make
	:; sudo make install


xz (liblzma)
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Needed for libxml2.

	:; ( cd "$DLDIR" && wget -c https://tukaani.org/xz/xz-5.2.5.tar.gz )
	:; cd "$WSDIR"
	:; tar xzf "$DLDIR"/xz-5.2.5.tar.gz
	:; cd xz-5.2.5
	:; ./configure --prefix="$PREFIX" $HOST_FLAG
	:; make
	:; sudo make install


libxml2
^^^^^^^

Needed for libneon.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// ...and for fontconfig
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

	:; ( cd "$DLDIR" && wget -c https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/archive/v2.9.14/libxml2-v2.9.14.tar.gz )
	:; cd "$WSDIR"
	:; tar xzf "$DLDIR"/libxml2-v2.9.14.tar.gz
	:; cd libxml2-v2.9.14
	:; ./autogen.sh --prefix="$PREFIX" $HOST_FLAG --without-python
	:; make
	:; sudo make install


gd (cgi)
^^^^^^^^

Note that for the general-case build libgd supports a huge dependency tree,
so for the NUT purposes we are going for as little as possible.

Initially the purpose was to have libgd installed to build/link against for
the Windows target. Subsequently more dependencies were documented, but still
further refinement may be needed to have it actually usable for CGI web pages
rendering.

Finally note that end-users would have to install a CGI-capable web server to
use this feature in practice.

* zlib: see above

* iconv:
+
Seems to be directly used by `libgd` (at least queried in its `configure` script):

	:; ( cd "$DLDIR" && wget -c https://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/libiconv/libiconv-1.17.tar.gz )
	:; cd "$WSDIR"
	:; tar xzf "$DLDIR"/libiconv-1.17.tar.gz
	:; cd libiconv-1.17
	:; ./configure --prefix="$PREFIX" $HOST_FLAG
	:; make
	:; sudo make install


* freetype:
+
NOTE: For some reason it won't build in an Ubuntu 20.04 running under WSL2 --
blocks running an `apinames.exe` program that it has just built. May be a
problem of the emulation layer (as it calls the EXE via `/tools/init`),
and/or of the system antivirus interaction?..

	:; ( cd "$DLDIR" && wget -c https://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/freetype/freetype-2.12.1.tar.gz )
	:; cd "$WSDIR"
	:; tar xzf "$DLDIR"/freetype-2.12.1.tar.gz
	:; cd freetype-2.12.1
	:; ./configure --prefix="$PREFIX" $HOST_FLAG --without-brotli
	:; make
	:; sudo make install


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
WIP - fontconfig not usable yet due to ICU failing to cross-build
Maybe an older version of either would fare better?..

* gperf is needed by fontconfig build routine as a tool usable on the build
  system, so a packaged install should suffice, e.g. `apt-get install gperf`.
  Otherwise, build one from source (and note that this may be needed e.g.
  for native builds on Windows, but not "just" for using a cross-binary that
  the build host can generate but not run natively).

	:; ( cd "$DLDIR" && wget -c http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gperf/gperf-3.1.tar.gz )
	:; cd "$WSDIR"
	:; tar xzf "$DLDIR"/gperf-3.1.tar.gz
	:; cd gperf-3.1
	:; ./configure --prefix="$PREFIX" $HOST_FLAG
	:; make
	:; sudo make install


* ICU:

For a cross-build of ICU, you should first build and install a copy
for the host system, then use it as a resource for the final build.
Set aside a good part of an hour to get this built:

	:; ( cd "$DLDIR" && wget -c https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/releases/download/release-71-1/icu4c-71_1-src.tgz )

	# This one is built for native host architecture and provides
	# some resources to ARCH builds later on:
	:; cd "$DLDIR"
	:; tar xzf icu4c-71_1-src.tgz
	:; rm -rf icu-native || true
	:; mv icu icu-native   # note, no version in the pathname
	:; cd icu-native/source
	:; ./configure CFLAGS= CXXFLAGS= LDFLAGS= ARCH=
	:; make

	:; cd "$WSDIR"
	:; tar xzf "$DLDIR"/icu4c-71_1-src.tgz
	:; cd icu/source
	:; ./configure --prefix="$PREFIX" $HOST_FLAG --with-cross-build="$DLDIR"/icu-native/source
	:; make
	:; sudo make install


* fontconfig:

	:; ( cd "$DLDIR" && wget -c https://www.freedesktop.org/software/fontconfig/release/fontconfig-2.14.0.tar.gz )
	:; cd "$WSDIR"
	:; tar xzf "$DLDIR"/fontconfig-2.14.0.tar.gz
	:; cd fontconfig-2.14.0/
	:; ./configure --prefix="$PREFIX" $HOST_FLAG --enable-libxml2
	:; make
	:; sudo make install

// for fontconfig
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


* libpng:

	:; ( cd "$DLDIR" && wget -c https://download.sourceforge.net/libpng/libpng-1.6.37.tar.gz )
	:; cd "$WSDIR"
	:; tar xzf "$DLDIR"/libpng-1.6.37.tar.gz
	:; cd libpng-1.6.37
	:; ./configure --prefix="$PREFIX" $HOST_FLAG
	:; make
	:; sudo make install

* libgd itself:
+
TODO: This works for 64-bit builds, however 32-bit ones are burdened with `@8`
or `@12` suffixes to symbol names, and subsequent link checks in NUT fail to
find `libgd` as usable -- so CGI is not built in 32-bit mode. According to
such context, this must be something about STDCALL and/or "extern C"...

	:; ( cd "$DLDIR" && wget -c https://github.com/libgd/libgd/releases/download/gd-2.3.3/libgd-2.3.3.tar.gz )
	:; cd "$WSDIR"
	:; tar xzf "$DLDIR"/libgd-2.3.3.tar.gz
	:; cd libgd-2.3.3
	:; ./configure --prefix="$PREFIX" $HOST_FLAG \
	    --with-png --with-freetype \
	    --without-tiff --without-jpeg --without-xpm \
	    --without-fontconfig
	# Note: currently we configure away almost all capabilities,
	# to match the dependency binaries (and/or headers) present
	# on the build system. Review resulting build recipes that
	# they DO NOT refer to system /usr/include locations!
	# In practice we would likely need the fontconfig pieces to work.
	:; make
	:; sudo make install


libmodbus
^^^^^^^^^

	:; ( cd "$DLDIR" && wget -c https://libmodbus.org/releases/libmodbus-3.1.7.tar.gz )
	:; cd "$WSDIR"
	:; tar xzf "$DLDIR"/libmodbus-3.1.7.tar.gz
	:; cd libmodbus-3.1.7
	:; ./configure --prefix="$PREFIX" $HOST_FLAG
	:; make
	:; sudo make install


net-snmp
^^^^^^^^

	:; ( cd "$DLDIR" && wget -c https://sourceforge.net/projects/net-snmp/files/net-snmp/5.9.1/net-snmp-5.9.1.tar.gz )
	:; cd "$WSDIR"
	:; tar xzf "$DLDIR"/net-snmp-5.9.1.tar.gz
	:; cd net-snmp-5.9.1
	:; yes "" | ./configure --prefix="$PREFIX" $HOST_FLAG \
	    --with-default-snmp-version=3 --disable-agent --disable-daemon \
	    --with-sys-contact="" --with-sys-location="" --with-logfile=none \
	    --with-persistent-directory="${PREFIX}/var/net-snmp" \
	    --disable-embedded-perl --without-perl-modules --disable-perl-cc-checks \
	    --enable-shared
	# NOTE: ./configure script may ask a few questions, or may just print
	# a banner that it would; hopefully all replies needed for current
	# version are covered above
	# The following long `LDFLAGS` ensure that shared `libnetsnmp-40.dll`
	# gets built and later installed (and siblings which NUT does not use):
	:; make LDFLAGS="-no-undefined -lws2_32 -lregex -Xlinker --ignore-unresolved-symbol=_app_name_long -Xlinker --ignore-unresolved-symbol=app_name_long"
	:; find . -type f -name '*.dll' -o -name '*.dll.a'
	:; sudo make install

NOTE: net-snmp tends to only `make` a static-linking library for Windows
by default (the shared library only appears with `LDFLAGS` proposed above).
In this case consumers must link not only with `-lnetsnmp` but also its
dependencies explicitly -- see `Libs.private` line in `netsnmp.pc` of
your build (or installation in `${PREFIX}/lib/pkgconfig/netsnmp.pc`).
Builds can extract this info with `pkg-config --libs --static netsnmp`
as NUT scenarios do (for mingw, if shared-linking attempt fails).


libneon
^^^^^^^

As of release 0.32.2 libneon failed to build  -- neither in Windows MSYS2 nor
in Linux mingw environments. Some tinkering was needed to make it happen, and
was posted as https://github.com/notroj/neon/pull/84 (pull request sourced
from https://github.com/jimklimov/neon/tree/fix-mingw-cross branch). Due to
this, instructions below differ from others by setting up an out-of-tree build
instead of a tarball download. Eventually it would hopefully suffice to fetch
https://notroj.github.io/neon/neon-0.32.5.tar.gz or newer (PR was merged after
libneon 0.32.4 release).

NOTE: Ability to `make docs` here relies on presence of `xmlto` program.
In NUT CI workers prepared according to `docs/config-prereqs.txt` this should
be among dependencies for `asciidoc`; beware that with prerequisites it has
quite a large installation footprint. Alternately check PR #69, or consult
the Makefiles for current `install` target definition to run its job without
`install-docs` part (example posted below).

	#:; ( cd "$DLDIR" && git clone -b fix-mingw-cross https://github.com/jimklimov/neon neon-git )

glib2
^^^^^

WARNING: Currently glib2 does not build, at least on WSL2 Ubuntu, fails to
find gettext (not built above).

Needed for avahi.

Requires `meson` build system, e.g. via:
------
:; sudo apt-get install meson
------

NOTE: Latest glib-2.73.3 as of this writing requires `meson >= 0.60.0` but the
one provided in WSL2 Ubuntu 20.04 OS packages is older (0.53.2). In this case,
try an older glib2 release, e.g. glib-2.72.1 seems compatible.

avahi
^^^^^

WARNING: Currently avahi does not build, at least on WSL2 Ubuntu, fails to
find glib2 (not built above).

Release 0.8 (and current git as of this writing) sources use `-Wl,-z...`
linking flags which are not supported by mingw `ld` tooling, and so fail
to configure.

[NOTE]
======
To build from Git sources or regenerate `configure` in tarball sources
like shown below, you should also have `gettextize` tool before running
`autogen.sh`, e.g. via:
------
:; sudo apt install intltool autopoint
:; ( cd "$DLDIR" && git clone https://github.com/lathiat/avahi avahi-git )
:; ( cd "$DLDIR/avahi-git" && ./autogen.sh )
# Stock script would go on to try configuring by default,
# and that bit fails in cross-env vars
------
======

	:; ( cd "$DLDIR" && wget -c https://github.com/lathiat/avahi/releases/download/v0.8/avahi-0.8.tar.gz )
	:; cd "$WSDIR"
	:; tar xzf "$DLDIR"/avahi-0.8.tar.gz
	:; cd avahi-0.8
	:; vi common/acx_pthread.m4
	# Edit `common/acx_pthread.m4` to remove `-Wl,-z,defs` near
	# AC_MSG_CHECKING([whether -pthread is sufficient with -shared])
	# Alternatively just edit `configure` script from the tarball.
	:; ./autogen.sh || true
	:; ./configure --prefix="$PREFIX" $HOST_FLAG
	:; make
	:; sudo make install

Cross-building NUT with MinGW in Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After preparing at least the required dependencies above, use one of
the following methods to compile NUT as:

* out-of-tree from git source (easier to iterate for development, so default):

	(cd scripts/Windows/ && ./build-mingw-nut.sh all64)
+
or, depending on the build environment(s) you have prepared,
+
	(cd scripts/Windows/ && ./build-mingw-nut.sh all32)
+
[NOTE]
======
This is also automated for common NUT CI build script, calling it like this:
------
# Try to guess bitness based on ARCH or CFLAGS:
BUILD_TYPE=cross-windows-mingw ./ci_build.sh

# Or specifically:
BUILD_TYPE=cross-windows-mingw-32 ./ci_build.sh
BUILD_TYPE=cross-windows-mingw-64 ./ci_build.sh
------
======


* an existing source tarball (can be fetched from NUT website):

	:; export SOURCEMODE=stable
	### Optionally: export VER_OPT=2.8.1
	:; cd scripts/Windows/
	:; ./build-mingw-nut.sh


* To (re-)build from scratch with a dist tarball, e.g. testing how a stable
release would fare, starting from a git checkout, use this:

	:; ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make dist && \
	    (cd scripts/Windows/ && SOURCEMODE=dist ./build-mingw-nut.sh all64)

If everything goes fine, you will find a NUT installation tree in 'nut_install'
sub-directory. Note the script accepts some parameters e.g. for 32/64 bit build
targets.

NOTE: For other ways of building and packaging, it might make sense for
a packaged delivery to also `make install DESTDIR=.../nut_install` from
the sources of dependency projects built above, or at least to copy the
built `*.dll` files from `${PREFIX}/bin` to `nut_install/bin`. For those
dependencies that are listed above, the script does this best-effort
activity (does not fail if some are missing, but running the programs
can fail later).

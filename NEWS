---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release notes for NUT 2.8.0 - what's new since 2.7.4:

NOTE: Earlier discussions (mailing list threads, GitHub issues, etc.) could
refer to this change set (too long in the making) as NUT 2.7.5.

 - New (optional) keywords for configuration files were added,
   so existing NUT 2.7.x builds would not accept them if some
   deployments switch versions back and forth -- due to this,
   semantically the version was bumped to NUT 2.8.x.

 - Add support for openssl-1.1.0 (Arjen de Korte)

 - libusb-1.0 API support in addition to libusb-0.1 API [#300]

 - Add support for `DISABLE_WEAK_SSL=true` in upsd.conf to disable older/weaker
   SSL/TLS protocols and ciphers: when NUT is built against relatively recent
   versions of OpenSSL or NSS it will be restricted to TLSv1.2 or better.
   For least-surprise, currently defaults to `false` and complains in log
   [PR #1043]

 - Add support for `ALLOW_NO_DEVICE=true` (as an upsd.conf flag or environment
   variable passed from caller of the program), to allow starting the data
   server initially without any device configurations and reloading it later
   to apply config changes on the fly [PR #766]

 - Add support for `debug_min=NUM` setting (ups.conf, upsd.conf, upsmon.conf)
   to specify the minimum debug verbosity for daemons. This allows "in-vivo"
   troubleshooting of service daemons without editing init scripts or service
   unit definitions.

 - Improve support for upsdrvctl for managing of numerous device configs,
   including default "maxretry=3" and a "nowait" option to complete the
   "start of everything" mode after triggering the drivers and not waiting
   for them to complete initializing. This matters on systems that monitor
   from dozens to hundreds of devices.

 - Drivers support a new value for `synchronous` setting, which is the
   new default now: `auto`.  Initially after driver start-up this mode
   acts as the older default `off`, but would fall back to `on` in case
   the driver fails to send reports to `upsd` by overflowing the socket
   buffer in async mode -- so the next connections of this driver uptime
   would be synchronized (potentially slower, but safer -- blocking on
   writes to the data server).  This adaptation would primarily impact
   and benefit devices with many (hundreds of) data points, such as
   ePDUs and daisy chains. [issue #1309, PR #1315]

 - Daemons such as upsd, upsmon, upslog, and device drivers previously
   implied that enabled debugging (or upslog to stdout) means foreground
   running, otherwise the daemon was always sent to the background.
   Now there are explicit options for this (`-F`/`-B`), although default
   behavior is retained. This change is used for simplified service unit
   definitions.

 - Improvements for device discovery or driver "lock-picking", including
   general support for:
   * "Standalone" mode (`-s` option), to monitor a device which is not
     detailed or mentioned in ups.conf
   * `NUT_ALTPIDPATH` and `NUT_STATEPATH` environment variables to override
     the paths built into the driver binary [PR #473 and #507]
   * "Driver data dump" mode (`-d` option), to poll a device for one or
     few ('update_count' ) loops, report discovered values (dump the data
     tree in upsc-like format), and exit. This complements the `nut-scanner`
     for finding and identifying devices.

 - support for new devices:
   * IBM 6000 VA LCD 4U Rack UPS; 5396-1Kx (USB)
   * Phoenix Contact QUINT-UPS model 2320461 (Modbus)
   * Tripp-Lite SU3000LCD2UHV (USB; protocol 1330)
   * Emerson Avocent PM3000 PDU (SNMP)
   * HPE ePDU (SNMP)

 - nutdrv_qx: enhanced estimation of remaining battery runtime based
   on speed of voltage drop, which varies as they age [PR #1027]

 - nutdrv_qx: several subdrivers added or improved, including:
   * "snr" subdriver with USB connection, for SNR-UPS-LID-XXXX [PR #1008].
     Note that end-users should reference explicitly the `snr` subdriver
     in their `ups.conf` settings because of USB chip using the same
     values of VendorID/ProductID as fabula_subdriver, fuji_subdriver,
     and krauler_subdriver.
   * "hunnox" subdriver, as a dialect of earlier "fabula" [PR #638]
     adds support for Hunnox HNX-850 with USB connection and reported to work
     for Powercool, Iron Guardian, ARES devices and possibly many others from
     discussions linking to the pull request which introduced the driver.
   * "phoenixtec" subdriver for Masterguard A and E series, device series
     A700/1000/2000/3000(-19) and E40/60/100(-19). [PR #975]
   * "ablerex" subdriver provided by the OEM vendor, note that it replaces
     "krauler_subdriver" as default handler for VID:PID 0xffff:0x0000
     [PR #1135]
   * Legrand HID defined and handled by "krauler_subdriver" by default
     [PR #1075, issue #616]
   * add new "armac" subdriver, tested with Armac R/2000I/PSW, but should
     support other UPSes that work with "PowerManagerII" software from
     Richcomm Technologies from around 2004-2005 [PR #1239, issue #1238]

 - microsol-apc (starting at version 0.68 as derived from solis 0.67):
   adding support for newer APC Back-UPS BR hardware, such as
   APC Back-UPS BZ1500, BZ2200BI and BZ2200I [PR #994]

 - pijuice: added new i2c bus driver for PiJuice HAT, a battery UPS module
   for the Raspberry Pi systems [PR #730]

 - huawei-ups2000: added new driver for USB (Linux 5.12+ so far) and Serial
   RS-232 Modbus device support of Huawei UPS2000/2000A (1kVA-3kVA) series,
   and possibly some related FSP UPS models. [PR #954]

 - socomec_jbus: added new driver for modbus-based JBUS protocol over serial
   RS-232 for Socomec UPS (tested with a DIGYS 3/3 15kVA model, working
   on Linux x86-64 and Raspberry Pi 3 ARM). [PR #1313]

 - adelsystem_cbi: added new driver for ADELSYSTEM CBI2801224A, an all-in-one
   12/24Vdc DC-UPS, which supports the modbus RTU communication protocol
   [PR #1282]

 - generic_modbus: added new driver for TCP and Serial Modbus device support.
   The driver has been tested against PULS UPS (model UB40.241) via
   MOXA ioLogikR1212 (RS485) and ioLogikE1212 (TCP/IP), and configuration
   allows to map custom registers and addresses to NUT events [PR #1052]

 - genericups: added support for FTTx battery backup devices, and new signal
   type mappings for the contact closure pins interpretation (RB for replace
   battery, BYPASS for disconnected battery, and "none" or NULL for signals
   to ignore) [PR #1061]

 - add devices to HCL/DDL:
   * APC Back-UPS CS (USB)
   * CPS CP1500EPFCLCD (USB)
   * CPS EC350G, EC750G (USB)
   * CPS PR2200LCDRT2U (SNMP)

 - Added C++ testing mock for TcpClient class (nutclientmem/MemClientStub:
   data stored in local memory) [PR #1034]

 - Dual Python 2 and 3 compatibility in development scripts; ability to
   run build activities and resulting built NUT programs on systems that
   do not have a binary named "python" [PR #1115 and some before it]

 - Added Russian translation for NUT-Monitor GUI client [PR #806]

 - Separated NUT-Monitor UI into two applications, NUT-Monitor-py2gtk2 and
   NUT-Monitor-py3qt5, suitable for two generations of Python ecosystem
   with their great differences; `NUT-Monitor` name is retained for wrapper
   script which calls one of these, such that the current system can execute
   [PRs #1310, #1354]

 - Various USB driver families: expanded device-matching with "device" in
   addition to "bus" and generic USB fields. This is needed to support
   multiple attached devices that seem identical by other fields (e.g.
   same vendor, same model, same USB bus, and no serial number) [PR #974]

 - Various USB driver families: Improved HID parsing for byte-stream to
   number conversions on different CPU architectures [PR #1024]

 - Various USB HID driver families: added support for composite devices
   utilizing interface greater than 0 for the UPS interface [PR #1044]

 - usbhid-ups:
   * added generic framework for fixing Report Descriptors which can be
     used for different manufacturers by adding code to the appropriate
     subdriver rather than polluting the main code with UPS specific
     exceptions, and applied fixes for known mistakes in (some releases
     of firmware for) CyberPower CPS*EPFCLCD [issue #439, PR #1245]
   * added `onlinedischarge` option for UPSes that report `OL+DISCHRG`
     when wall power is lost [PR #811]
   * changed detection of VendorID 0x06da handling of which is claimed
     by Liebert/Phoenixtec HID historically, and MGE HID (for AEG PROTECT
     NAS UPSes) since NUT 2.7.4, so that the higher-priority MGE subdriver
     would not grab each and all of the devices exposing that ID [PR #1357]
   * CPS HID: add input.frequency and output.frequency
   * OpenUPS2: only check OEM Information string once (fewer log messages)
   * Liebert GXT4 USB VID:PID [10AF:0000]
   * add battery voltage and input/output transfer voltage and frequency
     in Liebert/Phoenixtec HID mapping, to support PowerWalker VFI 2000 TGS

   * add a little delay between multicommands [PR #1228]
   * fix Eaton/MGE mapping for beeper handling
   * add IBM USB VID
   * add deep battery test for CyberPower OL3000RMXL2U
   * report the libusb version used

   * add new ever-hid subdriver to support EVER UPS devices (Sinline RT Series,
     Sinline RT XL Series, ECO PRO AVR CDS Series) [PR #431]
   * add ability to set `battery.mfr.date` for APC HID UPS [PR #1318]

   * several rounds of updates for Eaton devices, including new ATS and ePDU
     hardware families
   * fixed bit mask values for flags to surely use different numbers behind
     logical items (inevitably changing some of those macro symbols) [PR #1180]

 - snmp-ups and nut-scanner should now support more SNMPv3 Auth and Priv
   protocols, as available at NUT build time [PRs #1165, #1172]

 - nut-scanner: various improvements, including:
   * detection of libraries at runtime
   * tracing information
   * limiting parallelism (thread count) [PRs #1158, #1164]

 - nut-ipmipsu: improve FreeIPMI support to build cleanly against older and
   newer FreeIPMI versions [PR #1179]

 - the powerpanel driver now also supports CyberPower OR1500LCDRTXL2U with

 - solis: various improvements and fixes

 - liebert-esp2: Correct battery V scaling, update docs, implement split-phase
   unit support [PR #412]

 - tripplite: the "Tripp-Lite SmartUPS driver" as tested with SMART2200NET
   learned to discover the firmware generation and some device features,
   and in particular to manage power separately on one or two outlet groups
   [PR #1048]

 - tripplite_usb: updated to recognize the "3005" protocol [PR #584]

 - libnutclient: introduce getDevicesVariableValues() to improve performances
   when querying many devices (up to 15 times faster)

 - nut-driver-enumerator: introduced a script for Linux systemd and
   Solaris/illumos SMF to inspect current NUT configuration in ups.conf
   file and generate service management instances for each currently
   tracked power device. Also introduced services to monitor the NUT
   configuration and react to editions of this file, mostly intended
   for deployments that do massive monitoring of dynamically changing
   farms of power devices.

 - Fix File descriptors leaks by upsmon and upssched (SELinux errors)

 - systemd support improvements:
   * POWEROFF_WAIT
   * reload support for upsd
   * Deliver systemd-tmpfiles config to pre-create runtime locations
     [PR #1037 for Issue #1030]
   * Update units with SyslogIdentifier=%N for better logging [PR #1054]

 - upsrw: display the variable type beside ENUM / RANGE

 - Added `PROTVER` as alias to `NETVER` to report the protocol version in use.
   Note that NUT codebase itself does not use this value and handles commands
   and reported errors individually [issue #1347]

 - Implement status tracking for instant commands (instcmd) and variables
   settings (setvar): this allows to get the actual execution status from the
   driver, and is available in libraries and upscmd / upsrw [PR #659]

 - Add support for extra parameter for instant commands, both in library and
   in upscmd

 - dummy-ups can now specify `mode` as a driver argument, and separates the
   notion of `dummy-once` (new default for `*.dev` files that do not change)
   vs. `dummy-loop` (legacy default for `*.seq` and others) [issue #1385]

 - new protocol variables:
   * `input.phase.shift`
   * `outlet.N.name`
   * `outlet.N.type`
   * `battery.voltage.cell.max`, `battery.voltage.cell.min`
   * `battery.temperature.cell.max`, `battery.temperature.cell.min`
   * `battery.status`
   * `battery.capacity.nominal`
   * `battery.date.maintenance` (and clarified purpose of `battery.date`)
   * `battery.packs.external` (and clarified purpose of `battery.packs`)
   * `experimental.*` namespace introduced [PR #1046] to facilitate
     introduction of NUT drivers and their data points for which we do
     not yet have concepts, or which the original driver contributors
     did not map well per suitable NUT standards: this allows to balance
     having those drivers available in the project vs. least surprise
     for when the explicitly experimental names are changed to something
     stable and standardized.
   * Proposed to track Date and Time values (still as "opaque strings")
     preferably in representations compatible to ISO-8601/RFC-3339 [PR #1076]
     (standards update; changes to actual codebase to be applied in the future)
   ** New routine to convert a US formatted date string "MM/DD/YYYY" to an
      ISO 8601 Calendar date "YYYY-MM-DD" was added to snmp-ups.c [PR #1078]

 - Master/Slave terminology was deprecated in favor of Primary/Secondary
   modes of `upsmon` client:
   * Respective keywords in the configuration files (`upsd.users` and
     `upsmon.conf`) are supported as backwards-compatible settings,
     but the obsoleted values are no longer documented.
   * Protocol keyword support was similarly updated, with `upsmon` now
     first trying to elevate privileges with `PRIMARY <ups>` request,
     and falling back to `MASTER <ups>` just in case it talks to an
     older build of an `upsd` server.
   * For the principle of least surprise, NUT codebase still exposes the
     `net_master()` (as handler for `MASTER` net command) in header and
     C code for the sake of existing linked binaries, and returns the
     `OK MASTER-GRANTED` line to the older client that invoked it.
   * Newly introduced `net_primary()` (as handler for `PRIMARY` net command)
     calls the exact same application logic, but returns `OK PRIMARY-GRANTED`
     line to the client.
   * Python binding updated to handle both cases, as the only found in-tree
     protocol consumer of the full-line text.
   * For more details see issue #840 and several pull requests referenced
     from it, and discussions on NUT mailing lists.

 - Build fixes:
   * In general, numerous fixes were applied to ensure portability and avoid
     warnings (fixing a number of real bugs that caused them); CI was extended
     to keep the codebase free of those types of warnings which we have got
     rid of, requiring builds to succeed cleanly in several dozen combinations
     of compiler versions, C standard revisions (C99 upwards, though on many
     OSes with GNU99+ extensions), operating systems and CPU architectures.
   * Public CI introduced to automatically test every contribution (PR) and
     resulting increment of main NUT codebase, including Travis CI and LGTM.com
     services, and a Jenkins farm on virtual hardware donated by Fosshost.org;
     this augments testing earlier provided for some branches by Buildbot.
   * Added cppunit testing with valgrind for the C++ client library
   * Make targets added for shell script syntax checks for helper and service
     scripts
   * Make targets added for spellcheck and for maintenance of the dictionary,
     including incremental spellcheck to only parse recently edited text files
   * The AsciiDoc detection has been reworked to allow NUT to be built from
     source without requiring asciidoc/a2x (using pre-built man pages from
     the distribution tarball, for instance)
   * Makefile contents rearranged for more resilient out-of-tree and in-tree
     builds beside those made from the root workspace directory
   * Makefiles are tested with GNU Make and BSD Make to ensure portable recipes
   * More use of `pkg-config` to detect dependencies at configure time, as
     well as fail-safe detection of presence of pkg-config (and its macros)
     to survive and build without it too
   * "slibtool" pedantic nuances now supported, allowing an alternative to
     GNU libtool
   * Build scripts updated to remove obsoleted calls to cleanly work with
     autoconf-2.70 releases in 2020 (also works with 2.69 which was the
     earlier release since 2012)
   * Dynamic library loading used in certain programs and use-cases improved,
     especially for 64-bit vs 32-bit builds on multiple-bitness OSes
   * Logging routines like `upsdebugx()` were refactored as macros so there
     is slightly less overhead when logging is disabled [PRs #685 and #1100]
   * Numerous classes of compilation warnings eradicated, many of those being
     potential issues with implicit data type conversions and varied numeric
     type width, signedness, string buffer size, uninitialized variables or
     structure fields; some more in progress
   * Several logical errors found and fixed during this walk over codebase.
   * Cases where compilers were overly zealous and particular code was written
     the way wit was intentionally, including some comparisons that help with
     different-bitness builds but indeed seem superfluous in a certain single
     bitness, were commented and encased in pragmas to disable the warnings
   * Basic coding style (indentations, lack of trailing white space) applied
     per developer guide, but not automatically enforced/checked yet.

 - Due to changes needed to resolve build warnings, mostly about mismatching
   data types for some variables, some structure definitions and API signatures
   of several routines had to be changed for argument types, return types,
   or both. Primarily this change concerns internal implementation details
   (may impact update of NUT forks with custom drivers using those), but a
   few changes also happened in header files installed for builds configured
   `--with-dev` and so may impact `upsclient` and `nutclient` (C++) consumers.
   At the very least, binaries for those consumers should be rebuilt to remain
   stable with NUT 2.8.0 and not mismatch int-type sizes and other arguments.

 - As usual, more bugfixes, cleanup and improvements, on both source code
   and documentation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release notes for NUT 2.7.1 - what's new since 2.6.5:

 - This release is an interim release, part of the testing series, and the
   first release after the transition from Subversion to Git.
   The last release (2.6.5) is almost a year old. A lot of work has
   been done, but a good amount remains to achieve 2.8.0 goals.
   Please read the UPGRADING notes.

 - Added support for SSL via the Mozilla NSS library, in addition to the
   existing OpenSSL support.

 - Added a new driver, nutdrv_qx, for Megatec/Qx devices. This driver will
   eventually replace the blazer_ser and blazer_usb drivers. In particular, it
   adds support for Voltronic Power devices.

 - Increased USB_TIMEOUT to standards-compliant 5.000 seconds in most drivers.
   This should reduce the number of timeouts on low-speed USB 1.1 devices.

 - The jNut Java source has been split into a separate GitHub repository.

 - Added many devices to the HCL. Of particular note are many Tripp Lite USB
   HID PDC models which were tested against NUT by Tripp Lite.

 - Reworked some visual elements of the HCL. The output is better tailored for
   graphical and text-only browsers, but suggestions are welcome for additional
   accessibility enhancements.

 - Also increased timeouts and added redundant commands to improve reliability
   of mge-utalk driver.

 - Added the apcupsd-ups driver to interoperate with apcupsd installations.

 - Added documentation on creating subdrivers for snmp-ups and nutdrv_qx.

 - Added new drivers for the Riello UPS product line (riello_ser/riello_usb).

 - Many improvements to the BCM/XCP drivers have been merged in. This includes
   an improved data reception loop, and additional mappings.

 - Added a few variables to the Powercom HID mappings.

 - Updated the apcsmart driver, and renamed the previous driver to apcsmart-old.

 - Fixed the battery percentage calculation in the bestfcom driver.

 - libnutclient has been added as a C++ alternative to libupsclient.

 - Packaging files for Solaris and HP-UX (sponsored by Eaton)

 - Fix shutdown of Eaton HID, using usbhid-ups and mge-shut

 - usbhid-ups: final fix for APC Back UPS ES.  APC Back UPS ES devices have
   buggy firmware, and this version does not cause a regression. The max_report
   variable should be set automatically based on the USB identification values.

 - nut-scanner: fix crash

 - IPMI support can handle more different versions of FreeIPMI

 - Support power supplies scan over the network
   nut-scanner can now scan for power supplies with IPMI over LAN.
   This is currently limited to IPMI 1.5 only

 - Implement a framework to spell check documentation source files,
   using Aspell. This includes an interactive build target (make
   spellcheck-interactive), and an automated one (make spellcheck),
   mainly for QA / Buildbot purpose. Note that a base NUT dictionary
   is also available (docs/nut.dict), providing a glossary of terms
   related to power devices and management

 - Improve systemd integration

 - snmp-ups: Fixed a crash on outlet management, and added delta_ups MIB
   support. Also fixed mappings for upsBypassVoltage, upsBypassCurrent, and
   upsBypassPower in three-phase IETF MIB.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release notes for NUT 2.6.5 - what's new since 2.6.4:

 - This release fixes an important regression in upssched:
   any upssched.conf command that takes a second argument resulted in
   a defective frame sent to the parent process. Thus, the command was
   not executed (report and patch from Oliver Schonefeld)

 - Website hosting: free NUT from Eaton website hosting
   NUT website (http://www.networkupstools.org) is no longer hosted by Eaton.
   Arnaud Quette (NUT project leader) has taken over NUT hosting on his own,
   to give NUT back some independence.
   This effort is also part of a logic to stop crediting Eaton for
   contributions from others (especially Arnaud Quette, as an individual).
   The new hosting service is located, as for Arnaud's blog
   (http://arnaud.quette.fr) on Gandi servers, using PaaS. This will allow
   more flexibility and automation of the release process

 - macosx-ups: new OS X Power Sources meta-driver
   Mac OS X provides UPS status information in a format similar to
   what is shown for laptop batteries. This driver will convert that
   information into a format compatible with NUT (Charles Lepple).

 - support for new devices:
   Eaton ePDU Switched
   Online Zinto A (USB ID 0x06da:0x0601)
   REDi Blazer 400VA / 600VA / 800VA
   UNITEK Alpha650ipF and Alpha650ipE (USB ID 0x0f03:0x0001)

 - mge-shut driver has been replaced by a new implementation (newmge-shut).
   In case of issue with this new version, users can revert to oldmge-shut.

 - First NUT virtualization package: NUT now supports integration with
   VMware ESXI 5.0, through a native VIB package. This is, for the time
   being, an external effort from René Garcia (refer to the Download section
   on NUT website). But work is underway to improve this integration, and
   include it in the NUT source tree

 - IPMI support (nut-ipmipsu driver and nut-scanner): prepare for supporting
   API changes in upcoming FreeIPMI versions 1.1.x and 1.2.x.

 - snmp-ups now supports high precision values for APC, and more variables

 - the NUT variables and commands namespace has been fixed and
   completed, with the known and used variables that were missing.

 - more bugfixes, cleanup and improvements, on both source code and
   documentation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release notes for NUT 2.6.4 - what's new since 2.6.3:

 - This release Fix an important vulnerability in upsd
   (CVE-2012-2944: upsd can be remotely crashed)

   NUT server (upsd), from versions 2.4.0 to 2.6.3, are exposed to
   crashes when receiving random data from the network.
   This issue is related to the way NUT parses characters,
   especially from the network. Non printable characters were missed
   from strings operation (such as strlen), but still copied to the
   buffer, causing an overflow.
   Thus, fix NUT parser, to only allow the subset of ASCII charset from
   Space to ~
   (Reported by Sebastian Pohle, Alioth bug #313636, CVE-2012-2944)

   A separate patch, which applies to any faulty version, is also available:
   http://trac.networkupstools.org/projects/nut/changeset/3633

   For more information, refer to the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures:
   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-2944

 - A static source code analysis has been done by Michal Hlavinka from RedHat,
   using Coverity (12 issues fixed).

 - Add new "LIST CLIENTS" and "NETVER" commands to NUT network protocol.
   "NETVER" allows to retrieve the Network protocol version, while
   "LIST CLIENTS" provides the list of clients connected to a device.
   Refer to the developer guide, "Network protocol information" section for
   more information.

 - Support of ranges of values for writable variables has been added, to
   complete the existing enumerated values mechanism. This will start to
   appear in some drivers soon, beginning with Eaton. Refer to the developer
   guide, "Creating a new driver..." section for more information.

 - PyNUT.py has been updated to version 1.2.2, adding support for
   LIST CLIENTS, FSD, HELP and VER (Rene Martín Rodríguez)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release notes for NUT 2.6.3 - what's new since 2.6.2:

 - nut-scanner is now more portable, and provides more coherent option names.
   IPMI support has also been added, to discover local power supplies.
   This version brings weak runtime dependencies in libnutscan, which allows to
   compile nut-scanner with all options and to run according to the available
   dependencies (USB, SNMP, IPMI, ...).

 - libnutscan now provides pkg-config support and the needed header files are
   distributed. Some documentation is also available in the developer guide and
   manual pages have been updated and completed.

 - upsd doesn't anymore fail to start if at least one of the listening
   interface is available. This is needed on systems where either IPv4 or IPv6
   is disabled, and no explicit LISTEN directive has been specified.

 - Avahi support is now automatically enabled, upon detection

 - jNut (NUT Java interface) adds device discovery support, through a
   nut-scanner wrapper ; jNutWebAPI, a HTTP/JSON web service interface, has
   also been added to interact with upsd and nut-scanner.

 - Base files for HPUX packaging have been added. This is still a work in
   progress.

 - Compilation on IBM AIX has been fixed (namespace conflict with ctypes).

 - more bugfixes, cleanup and improvements, on both source code and
   documentation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release notes for NUT 2.6.2 - what's new since 2.6.1:

 - NUT can now monitor power supply units (PSU) in servers, through IPMI, using
   the new experimental 'nut-ipmipsu' driver. Users are encouraged to test it,
   and send feedback and debug output to the development mailing list.
   This requires GNU FreeIPMI (0.8.5 or higher) development package or files.
   Thanks goes to Al Chu, FreeIPMI project leader, for his help during this
   development.

 - NUT now provides a tool, called 'nut-scanner', to discover supported devices,
   both local and remote. nut-scanner will help to ease the configuration step,
   and power infrastructure discovery.
   This development, sponsored by Eaton, supports the following methods:
   * USB,
   * SNMP,
   * XML/HTTP (from Eaton),
   * NUT servers, using the classic connect or Avahi / mDNS methods.

   IPMI support will be added in the next release.
   A separate library, called 'libnutscan', is also available to provide these
   feature. Future NUT releases will provides binding for the supported
   languages (Perl, Python and Java).

 - NUT now provides a Java interface called 'jNut'.
   This development, sponsored by Eaton, is currently limited to the client
   interface. But it will be broaden to device discovery and configuration in
   the future.
   For more info, refer to nut/scripts/java/README, or the developer guide
   (chapter 'Creating new client'). Javadoc documentation is also provided,
   along with Java archives (.jar) in the Download section.

 - support for new devices: Eaton 3S ; Cyber Power Systems CP1000AVRLCD ;
   various APC models equipped with APC AP9618 management card, including APC
   Smart-UPS RT XL ;  Orvaldi 750 / 900SP ; POWEREX VI 1000 LED ; PowerWalker
   VI 850 LCD ; SVEN Power Pro+ series (USB ID ffff:0000).

 - A regression has been fixed in udev rules file. This previously caused
   permission issues to owners of some USB devices.

 - Avahi support has been added, for NUT mDNS publication, through a static
   service file (nut/scripts/avahi/nut.service).

 - usbhid-ups has had Eaton completion: some features have been improved, such
   as 'output.voltage.nominal' ; 3S Eco control support has been added, along
   with battery.runtime.low and end of battery life (life cycle monitoring)
   support ; new measurements for 5 PX are also supported now (outlet power
   factor, power, real power and current).

 - apcsmart has been updated to support more variables and features ; the
   previous driver is however still available as 'apcsmart-old', in case of
   issues.

 - bcmxcp now supports per outlet startup and shutdown delays setting ; shutdown
   delay is also used, when available, for outlet.n.shutdown.return instead of
   the default 3 seconds.

 - snmp-ups.c has a new initialization method, that uses sysObjectID, which is
   a pointer to the preferred MIB of the device, to detect supported devices.
   This speeds up even more init stage and should render void the use of 'mib'
   option. SNMP v3 session initialization has also been fixed, and Eaton PDU
   support has been completed.

 - Initial support has been added for systemd, the System and Service Manager
   from RedHat.

 - The chapter 'NUT configuration management with Augeas' of the developer guide
   has received some completion: a complete Python Augeas example code is now
   provided.

 - Finally, after years of dedication to NUT, Arjen de Korte is now retired.
   Sincere thanks to you Arjen from us all.

   PDUs, either natively (ie using NUT snmp-ups driver), or through a binding to
   the Powerman daemon. The list of supported PDUs is already quite long,
   including: Eaton ePDUs (Managed and Monitored), some Aphel models, some
   Raritan PDUs, and the whole list of Powerman supported devices:
   http://powerman.sourceforge.net/supported.html

 - support for new devices: the various PDUs cited above, Chloride Desk Power
   650, Cyber Power Systems Value 400E/600E/800E (USB models), Delta GES602N,
   Digitus DN-170020, the whole Eaton ranges (mostly composed of MGE Office
   Protection Systems and Powerware units) including BladeUPS, Forza Power
   Technologies SL-1001, HP PowerTrust 2997A, HP R/T 2200 G2, Infosec XP 1000
   and XP 500, Ippon Back Power Pro (serial and USB), Kebo 1200D/D Series,
   Liebert PowerSure Personal XT, MGE Office Protection Systems Protection
   Station, Neus 400va and 600va, Phasak 400VA and 600VA, Plexus 500VA, Powercom
   Black Knight PRO / King PRO and Imperial, PowerKinetics BlackOut Buster,
   Sweex 1000 USB, UNITEK Alpha 500, WinPower CPM-800.

 - NUT now embeds Python client support through the PyNUTClient module and the
   NUT-Monitor application. Both are from David Goncalves, and are still
   available from http://www.lestat.st.
   For more information, refer to scripts/python/README.

 - the dummy-ups driver now support a "repeater" mode. This allows it to act as
   a NUT client, and to forward data. This can be useful for supervision and
   load sharing purposes.

 - tcp-wrappers support has been added to the upsd server, to grant users access
   by source IP for commands that require to be logged into the server. This
   replaces the previous internal implementation (ACL in upsd.conf).

 - the nut.conf file has been introduced to standardize startup configuration
   across the various systems.

 - NUT now ships a bash completion function for 'upsc' command
   (scripts/misc/nut.bash_completion). Simply copy it to /etc/bash_completion.d

 - many internal changes to improve maintainability, while lowering the
   maintenance cost (thus allowing developers to focus on what matters: the
   code!). Examples of this are:
   - the USB information automatic extraction to generate the various USB helper
     files,
   - the upsdrv_info_t structure to track more driver information, and remove
     the need for the upsdrv_banner() function
   - common USB code refactoring, as it is done for the serial functions.

 - tons of bugfixes, cleanup and improvements to make NUT stronger than ever!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release notes for NUT 2.2.2 - what's new since 2.2.1:

 - support for new devices: APC BACK-UPS XS LCD, Atlantis Land,
   Mustek Powermust Office 650, Oneac XAU models, Powerware PW5115 and
   PW9120 (USB), Nitram Elite 2005

 - Integrated Power Management (NUT HAL integration) has reached a
   major milestone: it is now the most advanced UPS integration into
   Power Management layer known in existing OSs. It has received many
   corrections and improvements, and allows to PowerOff the UPS at the
   end of a power cycle (which is the most important feature, not
   supported on other systems).
   The various files are now installed into the correct location.

 - the usbhid-ups driver has received attention. Most notably, the
   shutdown handling has been reworked, and support for MGE UPS SYSTEMS
   3 phases units has been added.

 - snmp-ups now supports MGE* Environment Sensor (ref 66 846).
   The ambient.temperature reporting has also been fixed for units
   other than APC.

 - the netxml-ups driver has appeared to support MGE* network HTTP/XML
   cards.

 - NUT now distributes by default the shared version of libupsclient
   (version 1.0.0), and use this for the provided clients (upsmon, upsc,
   upsrw, upscmd). This is part of an effort to reduce NUT's footprint,
   both on disk and in memory.

 - powerpanel has reach a new step toward the replacement of nitram and
   cpsups drivers. The final step is scheduled for NUT 2.4.

 - many changes, cleanup and fixes to the NUT core and various drivers.

 - the udev rules, for Linux hotplug support of the USB UPSs, has been
   updated to support kernel newer than 2.6.22.

 - the megatec and megatec_usb drivers have also been backported from the
   development (trunk) version.

 - the client development files have also received some care:
   the upsclient pkg-config file has been fixed, and the upsclient.h
   file allows older NUT clients to continue using the UPSCONN structure.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release notes for NUT 2.2.0 - what's new since 2.0.5:

   as usbhid-ups, but communicate over a serial link. It will eventually
   replace the current mge-shut driver.

 - client commands (upsc, upsrw and upscmd): hostname is now optional,
   and defaults to "localhost"

 - many drivers have been improved and have received bug fixes:
   powerpanel, megatec, megatec_usb, safenet, tripplite_usb, gamatronic,

   [Ulf Harnhammar]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release notes for NUT 2.0.0 - what's new since 1.4.x:

 - The new naming scheme for variables and commands (introduced in 1.4)
   is now mandatory.  The 1.4 tree supported both the old (STATUS) and
   the new (ups.status) as a transitional release, and now that time is
   over.

   This means that 2.0 is generally smaller than 1.4 code, since the
   interim compatibility hacks have been removed.

 - New serial handling code has been added, with greatly simplified
   operations.  The old mess involving repeated calls to sigaction,
   alarm, and read has been condensed to a select-read loop.

   This change allows drivers which don't do any serial communications
   at all (hidups, snmp-ups) to drop that baggage, so they are a bit
   smaller when compiled.

 - The drivers now recognize "chroot=' and 'user=' in the global section
   of ups.conf.  This means you don't have to use -r and -u when
   starting upsdrvctl.

 - upsmon now supports the -K argument to check for the presence of the
   POWERDOWNFLAG file.  If it exists and contains the magic string, then
   upsmon will exit(EXIT_SUCCESS).  Otherwise, it will
   exit(EXIT_FAILURE).

   This feature can be used to simplify shutdown scripts, since now you
   don't have to keep the script in sync with the upsmon.conf.

 - Many small things like signed value comparisons, int vs. size_t and
   proper use of const/struct were fixed throughout the source.  These
   were mostly for correctness, but a few potential bugs involving very
   big or very small numbers were fixed at the same time.

 - The access control system in upsd.conf has been reworked and
   simplified.  Since access levels have become meaningless in recent
   releases, the new system is just ACCEPT <acl> or REJECT <acl>.

   If you are upgrading from a previous version of the software, you
   will have to edit your upsd.conf to use this method.  See
   the UPGRADING file for more details.

 - The build process now halts when make fails in one of the
   subdirectories.
   [Petter Reinholdtsen, Charles Lepple]

 - Helper data for using upsclient via pkgconfig is now created if
   pkgconfig is detected when configure runs.
   [Arnaud Quette]

 - The polling interval in drivers may now be set with 'pollinterval'
   in ups.conf.
   [Gabriel Faber]

 - Blazer UPS equipment is now supported with the blazer driver.
   [Phil Hutton]

 - Energizer USB UPS hardware is now supported on Linux with a new
   experimental driver.
   [Viktor T. Toth]

 - The newhidups driver has been merged as the first step towards
   portable USB UPS support.  This will eventually replace the old
   Linux-only hidups driver.  The newhidups driver is tagged
   experimental since it is under active development.
   [Arnaud Quette, Charles Lepple]

 - The newapc driver has been renamed to apcsmart, replacing the old
   driver with that name. If you used the newapc driver, be sure to
   delete the old binary and fix your ups.conf.

 - The apcsmart driver now supports asynchronous notification data
   from the hardware, which means it can wake up as soon as something
   happens.  This affects the OL/OB/LB/RB data in ups.status, and
   generally reduces the latency in dispatching status changes by a few
   seconds.

 - The apcsmart driver can now support quirky hardware which does not
   provide the usual listing of valid command characters.  This feature
   is necessary to monitor new models like the APC CS 350 and old ones
   like the Matrix 5000.  It also now has sdtype=4 to handle the strange
   shutdown behavior on the CS series.

 - The belkin driver now works around broken firmware version 001,
   avoiding a lengthy delay at startup.  It also implements the shutdown
   sequence differently, and should actually work on more hardware now.

 - The bestups driver has been slowed down to play nicer with the
   hardware, and is much more reliable as a result.  Among other things,
   it should always detect the UPS on the first try, meaning no more
   "dot dot dot" when it starts.

 - The cyberpower driver is no longer tagged experimental, and now
   supports powering off the load.  It also supports battery tests via
   instcmds.

 - Effekta MT 2000 RM hardware is now supported by the fentonups driver.
   [Christoph Moar]

 - The new safenet driver supports UPS hardware that uses the protocol
   of the same name.  This includes models from many manufacturers,
   including Fairstone, Fenton, Gemini, Powerwell, Repotec, Soltec and
   Sweex.  See the README or driver.list for the full details.
   [Arjen de Korte]

 - The genericups driver now has type 20 to monitor the Powerware 5119
   RM.  See http://lists.exploits.org/ups/Oct2003/00052.html.
   [Daniel Thompson]

 - The belkinunv driver has been added to allow monitoring Belkin
   Universal UPS hardware.
   [Peter Selinger]

 - Cyber Power Systems 1100AVR hardware which has a different protocol
   than the existing binary type (supported by 'cyberpower') is now
   supported by the experimental cyberpower1100 driver.
   [Walt Holman]

 - upsdrvctl now returns success or failure information in the exit
   code.  Any failure during a requested operation will result in a
   nonzero value (specifically EXIT_FAILURE).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release notes for NUT 1.4.0 - what's new since 1.2.x:

 - The drivers and upsd now communicate over Unix domain sockets instead
   of state files, shared memory, or state files with mmap.  This change
   makes many things possible, including the new dynamic variable and
   command naming scheme described below.

   There is a new development tool called sockdebug in the server
   directory for debugging driver-server communications on the sockets.

 - The old static variable scheme has been replaced by a new dynamic
   implementation.  Vague names have been turned into meaningful names
   that fit into an organized system.  UTILITY is now input.voltage.
   OUTVOLT is now output.voltage.

   This also applies to the names of instant commands.  BTEST1 is
   test.battery.start, and BTEST0 is test.battery.stop.

   The old names are still supported for compatibility with older
   clients.  This compatibility mode will be maintained throughout
   the 1.4 series, and will be gone by the release of 2.0.  Users
   with older clients are encouraged to upgrade their software
   during this time.

 - The network protocol has been expanded to handle these new names.
   Older functions which only apply to the old names will continue to
   be supported through the 1.4 series.

 - The drivers and server (upsd) can now change their user ids and
   chroot themselves with the new -u and -r arguments.  This lets you
   create a "chroot jail" with the bare minimum components.

   This technique is used to provide a higher degree of security.  If
   someone exploited upsd to get a shell somehow, they would be stuck
   in the jail.

 - upssched now explicitly confirms reception of timer commands before
   exiting.  This was done to avoid a race where one process would
   exit right when another one was starting.  The second one would
   believe its command had been handled when it had been lost.

 - upslog has been reworked to use standard getopt parsing to provide
   the monitoring settings.  The old way of specifying arguments is
   still supported for backwards compatibility.

   upslog has also been changed to only parse the format string once,
   rather than doing it every time through the loop.  This should
   provide a minuscule drop in CPU utilization.

 - Usernames are now required in upsmon and upsd.  This means that you
   must add a username to your MONITOR lines in upsmon.conf and then
   create a matching user in upsd.users.

   Installations from the 1.2 era probably already use usernames, so
   this mostly affects those from 1.0 and before.

 - Drivers are now pinged regularly by upsd when they aren't posting
   updates about the UPS status.  This provides another check in the
   data validation process.  If upsd fails to get a response within
   a few seconds, the UPS will be marked stale.

 - A few minor memory leaks were discovered with valgrind and squashed.

 - upsstats now reuses connections to upsd when cycling through multiple
   entries in the hosts.conf.  This makes things a bit faster and
   avoids some of the noise in the syslog.

   This only applies to entries that are adjacent.  To take advantage
   of this feature, you may have to rearrange them.

	MONITOR ups-1@host-1 ...
	MONITOR ups-1@host-2 ...
	MONITOR ups-2@host-2 ...
	MONITOR ups-3@host-3 ...

   Connection reuse for nonadjacent entries may be considered in the
   future.

 - upsd now warns about insecure configuration files at startup.
   These files (upsd.conf, upsd.users, and the certfile) should
   only be readable by upsd.  Never make them world-readable.

 - The programs no longer print "shutting down" when they are just
   exiting.  This was changed to avoid confusion about the term, since
   "shutting down" has a special meaning in UPS software.

 - Signal handlers no longer do any significant amount of work.  Some of
   the programs used to do numerous things in there, raising concerns
   about reentrancy.  They now set flags and allow the main loop to do
   the actual work from there.

 - A bug in upsmon where NOTIFYFLAG settings could be ignored was fixed.

 - Group handling has been changed.  configure no longer accepts
   --with-group, and the programs no longer setgid() to a hardcoded
   value.  They now setgid() to the primary group of whatever the
   user value may be.

   This may be compiled in with --with-user as before, and many programs
   accept -u to override it at runtime.

 - The state path is no longer created during 'make install'.  Users
   are now expected to create it themselves.  This removes a lot of
   evil complexity from the build and install sequences.

 - upsd no longer implements the DROP access command, as it
   could confuse the clients by getting them out of sync.  DROP is now
   implemented as DENY, which sends an error message.  If you use DROP,
   you should change it to DENY rather than relying on this
   compatibility measure.

 - The belkin driver no longer reports OFF and OL at the same time.

 - The bestups driver no longer sleeps during polls, which makes it
   more responsive to things like instant commands.

 - The cyberpower driver now has much better hardware detection code
   and no longer freezes at startup under some conditions.  It also now
   supports the shutdown function.  Instant commands for shutdowns and
   battery tests were also added.

 - The dummyups testing driver has been removed.  The dummycons testing
   driver can do everything that dummyups once did and much more.
   dummycons is also now built by default for easier testing.

 - The newapc driver has been reworked to take advantage of the new
   internal driver state functions.  Some variables without an obvious
   purpose were dropped.

 - The newapc driver now sends all five bytes when using sdtype 1.
   Previously it didn't send the entire string, and it didn't work.
   [Don Lewis]

 - The hidups driver has been expanded to allow for setting variables,
   a shutdown sequence, and more.
   [Arnaud Quette]

 - The mge-utalk driver had trouble establishing communications in
   some cases due to the RTS line being set.  This has been fixed.

   The mge-shut driver has been added to the tree, and has replaced
   the older mge-ellipse driver.
   [Arnaud Quette, Philippe Marzouk]

 - Outlet-level control has been defined in the variable tree, and will
   be added to drivers where the hardware supports it.  This can be
   used to shut down some components earlier than others to prolong
   your runtime on battery.

   This is supported in the mge-shut driver now, and may show up in
   others before long.
   [Arnaud Quette]

 - KIN-2200AP hardware is now recognized by the powercom driver.
   This change may also support other KIN-xxxxAP equipment.
   [Preston A. Elder]

 - The 1.1kVA UPS is now supported by the bestuferrups driver.  This
   driver was also changed to allow easy addition of more models
   in the future.
   [Bob Apodaca]

 - The fentonups driver can now handle devices which implement the
   "I" detection differently, and now supports the Giant/WELI 500
   as a result.
   [Joon Guillen]

 - The serial number of the UPS being monitored can now be specified
   with serial= in ups.conf in the genericups driver.
   [Shaul Karl]

 - The newapc driver now sends ESC to break out of menus when the
   initial detection fails.  Some new APC models have interactive menus
   on the serial port, and the driver couldn't handle them before.

 - The snmp-ups driver now reports ambient temperature and humidity
   data for APC equipment.  It also now supports the shutdown.reboot and
   shutdown.reboot.graceful commands.
   [Dmitry Frolov]

 - The list of supported variables and commands in the snmp-ups driver
   has been expanded.
   [Arnaud Quette, J.W. Hoogervorst]

 - Various drivers now report bypass mode with the BYP status word.
   [Arnaud Quette]

 - Energy Sistem equipment is now supported with the esupssmart driver.
   [Antonio Trujillo Coronado]

 - The Tripp-Lite SU series (SmartOnline) is supported with the new
   tripplitesu driver.
   [Allan Hessenflow]

 - The HP PowerTrust A2994A is now recognized by the hp driver.
   [Jan Sporbeck]

 - Many drivers were cleaned up to perform basic sanity checks on the
   status data before using it.

 - An explicit cleanup function has been added to the driver core to
   ensure that all dynamic resources are freed before exiting.  This
   is part of the larger process to check for memory leaks and other
   bad things.
   [Arnaud Quette]

 - upsd now provides variable descriptions from an auxiliary file.
   This file is optional, which allows for a smaller memory footprint.
   It can also be edited for localization or other customizations.

 - upsimage and upsstats can now render BATTVOLT data.
   [Andrew R. Ghali]

 - String handling has been cleaned up throughout the tree.  Calls to
   functions like strcpy and strcat were either replaced with other
   (range-checking) functions or were rewritten to avoid it.

 - Many compile-time defaults may now be overridden at runtime.  In
   the environment NUT_CONFPATH and NUT_STATEPATH may be used.
   upsdrvctl has been changed to execve to pass these along to the
   drivers.  ups.conf now supports driverpath=, and upsd.conf supports
   DATAPATH.
   [Bryan Henderson]

 - The configure --with-gd switches now actually do something useful
   when gd has been installed outside the default search directories.
   [Patrik Schindler]

 - The inline keyword is now handled properly on systems which do not
   support it or have it specified as another name.  This was breaking
   compiles on some systems.
   [Petter Reinholdtsen]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release notes for NUT 1.2.2 - what's new since 1.2.1:

 - The snmp-ups driver has been upgraded and expanded.  It now supports
   multiple MIBs, meaning it can handle RFC 1628, APCC, and MGE
   equipment.  You can pick the right one with "mibs=" in ups.conf.

   Support for setting variable and instant commands is also available.
   [Arnaud Quette and Dmitry Frolov]

 - The powernet driver has been upgraded.  It now supports more
   variables, has cleaner logging, and may now be considered stable.
   [Dmitry Frolov]

 - The hidups driver now supports physical port IDs.  This avoids most
   of the problems where the hiddev* names can jump around too easily.
   It will now stay in the same place as long as you keep it plugged
   into the same physical port.  See the ChangeLog file for more details.
   [David Brownell]

 - The hidups driver now also supports the MFR variable on APC
   Back-UPS ES equipment.
   [Jonathan A. Davis]

 - The sms driver has been updated to version 0.70.
   [Marcio Gomes]

 - The bestups driver now recognizes Best Power Axxium Rackmount
   equipment.
   [Ales Casar]

 - The liebert driver now uses O_NONBLOCK, and should now work
   consistently on OpenBSD as a result.
   [Alex Cichowski]

 - The liebert driver also now uses debouncing logic on the status
   lines.  It was possible to get false readings that would start a
   shutdown or just annoy users with excessive onbatt/online notify
   messages.  The new code forces the status to settle down for 3 polls
   before accepting the new value.

   This means that very short power events may not be detected.  The
   alternative is having your machine shut down just because it decided
   to wiggle over to OB LB for a few seconds.

 - upsmon has had the disconnect logic fixed so the "communications
   lost" (COMMBAD) notify will actually go out when the connection
   fails.
   [Steve Monett]

 - upssched now uses a lock file to prevent a race where two could
   start at the same time.  The second upssched would "win", and the
   first one would be unreachable.  This had the side-effect of not
   being able to cancel timers on the first one.	

   If you use upssched, you must define the LOCKFN directive when
   upgrading to this version, or it will not work.
   [Gaspar Bakos]

 - The packaging and scripts for Red Hat systems have been updated.
   [Antonino Albanese]

 - upsd is now a bit more lenient about access levels in the
   'numlogins' check, which is what caused the problem in upsmon
   (next item).

 - upsmon no longer gets stuck in slavesync() when upsd is configured
   to drop certain queries.  This usually happened at the worst
   possible time: in the middle of a shutdown.
   [John David Garza]

 - The upsclient functions now do more sanity checking on data from
   upsd so a short read won't return garbage to the callers.

 - upsset now works properly with ENUM/VARTYPE values for multiple
   UPSes on a single upsd.
   [Dmitry Frolov]

 - Various portability fixes for building on SGI were applied.
   [Andrea Suatoni]

 - upsd no longer tries to reference a deleted client structure if the
   client disconnects at the wrong time.  Previously, it tried to use
   that pointer after the sendback() function had already failed on
   write and deleted the client.  This could cause upsd to segfault
   depending on what areas were accessed.
   [Patrik Schindler]

Release notes for NUT 1.2.1 - what's new since 1.2.0:

 - The sms driver is back, with support for Microlink Manager III
   hardware. [Marcio Gomes]

 - Fideltronik Ares Series hardware is now supported as genericups type
   19.  [Tomek Orzechowski and Arkadiusz Mikiewicz]

 - The drivers no longer silently drop instant commands or set commands
   from upsd that happen to get fragmented in transit.
   [linux@horizon.com]

 - The old multilink driver is back with a new name: liebert.  It
   supports Liebert UPStation GXE hardware with the contact-closure
   cable.  This is currently an experimental driver as there is no
   way to power down the load.

 - configure now picks up the right flags for gd automatically if gd
   2.0.8 or higher is installed.  This greatly simplifies the CGI build
   process for most users.

 - Shutdowns on FreeBSD using the genericups driver should work again.
   [Petri Riihikallio]

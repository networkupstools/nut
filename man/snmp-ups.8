.SH NAME
snmp\(hyups \- Multi\(hyMIB Driver for SNMP UPS equipment
.SH NOTE
This man page only documents the hardware\(hyspecific features of the
snmp\(hyups driver.  For information about the core driver, see
\fBnutupsdrv\fR(8).

.SH SUPPORTED HARDWARE
The new snmp\(hyups driver supports a wide range of devices by loading various MIBS:
.IP "ietf:"
UPS that is RFC 1628 (UPS MIB) compliant, ie MGE UPS SYSTEMS, Liebert, perhaps others (default)
.IP "mge:"
MGE UPS SYSTEMS devices with SNMP cards (ref 66062, 66045, 66074 and 66244)
.IP "apcc:"
APC AP9606 APC Web/SNMP management card, perhaps others
.IP "netvision:"
Socomec Sicon UPS with Netvision Web/SNMP management card/external box
.IP "pw:"
Powerware devices with ConnectUPS SNMP cards

.SH EXTRA ARGUMENTS

This driver supports the following optional settings in the
\fBups.conf\fR(5):

.IP "mibs=\fIname\fR"
Set MIB compliance (default=auto, allowed ietf,mge,apcc,netvision,pw).
With auto the driver will try a select set of objets untill it finds one
that the device responds to.

.IP "community=\fIname\fR"
Set community name (default = public).
Note that you require a RW community name to perform UPS settings (as for a powerdown).

.IP "snmp_version=\fIversion\fR"
Set SNMP version (default = v1, the other allowed value is v2c)

.IP "pollfreq=\fIvalue\fR"
Set polling frequency in seconds, to reduce network flow (default=30)

.IP "notransferoids"
Disable the monitoring of the low and high voltage transfer OIDs in
the hardware.  This will remove input.transfer.low and input.transfer.high
from the list of variables.  This should only be used on APCC Symmetra
equipment which has strangeness in the three\(hyphase power reporting.

.SH REQUIREMENTS
You will need to install the Net\(hySNMP package from 
http://www.net\(hysnmp.org/ before building this driver.

.SH EXPERIMENTAL DRIVER
This driver has been tagged experimental, even if it has been reported
to be stable. Thus it is not suitable for production systems and it is
not built by default. This is mainly due to the fact that there is still
no proper upsdrv_shutdown() function implemented !

.SH INSTALLATION
This driver is not built by default.  You can build it by using
"configure \-\-with\-snmp=yes" before calling make.

.SH IMPLEMENTATION
The hostname of the UPS is specified with the "port" value in
\fBups.conf\fR, i.e.:

.nf
	[snmp]
		driver = snmp\-ups
		port = snmp\-ups.example.com
		community = public
		snmp_version = v1
		mibs = ietf
		pollfreq = 15

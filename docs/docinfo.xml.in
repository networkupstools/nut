    <revnumber>2.8.1</revnumber>
    <date>2023-10-31</date>
    <authorinitials>JK</authorinitials>
    <revremark>
        Some changes to API, docs and recipes, in particular to simplify local
        builds and tests (e.g. to help end-users check if current NUT codebase
        trunk has already fixed an issue they see with a packaged installation).
        Revived NUT for Windows effort, further improved other OS integrations.
        NUT became reference for "UPS management protocol", Informational RFC 9271.
        Documentation files refactored to ease maintenance.
        More drivers and new driver categories introduced.

    <date>2022-04-26</date>
    <authorinitials>JK</authorinitials>
    <revremark>
        Change of maintainer.
        Many changes to API, docs (both style and content), and recipes,
        with a stress on non-regression test-ability, run-time debug-ability,
        general codebase maintainability, as well as OS integrations (notably
        nut-driver-enumerator for systemd and SMF service instance maintenance).
        Added a lot in area of CI support and documented pre-requisite package
        lists for numerous platforms, and CI agent set-up. Added libusb-1.x
        support and many new driver categories (and drivers), and daisychain
        device connection support. Instant commands enhanced with TRACKING to
        enable protocol-based waiting for completion of a particular INSTCMD
        or SET operation.

Customized Jenkins+NUT logo derived from NUT resources and

as published at https://www.jenkins.io/artwork/ collection

The resulting image comes in a few versions as was needed by
different design consumers (Jenkins banner, Github Auth, etc.)
and include the base image on white background trimmed to the
rectangle it occupies, same on transparent background, also same
with padding to be a square canvas (as used in avatars), and a
downscaled image for the Jenkins dashboard banner. There are
variants in several resolutions available, and options with a
larger or smaller NUT logo served on the Jenkins butler's plate.

The fosshost.org_Host_Dark_56px.png was downscaled from resources
at https://fosshost.org/media/ to fit into the Jenkins dashboard
banner and remain readable. Thanks to Fosshost for providing the
machines involved in the new NUT CI farm!

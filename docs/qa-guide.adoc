Abstract
--------

The aim of this document is to describe the different ways we ensure and
maintain the source code quality of Network UPS Tools, its portability to
various platforms, and non-regression.

Previous NUT releases may have included parts of this documentation in the
developer guide or user manual. Most of this information can be applied to
both automated testing environments and local development workflows.

Code and recipe analysis
------------------------

GNU Autotools distcheck
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[[CI_distcheck]]

The Network UPS Tools project code base is managed by the
link:https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/GNU-Build-System.html[GNU
Build System] colloquially known as "The Autotools", which include `autoconf`,
`automake` and many other components. Some of their important roles are to
generate the portable shell `configure` script to detect build environment
capabilities and other nuances, and to help actually build the project with
`Makefile` recipes (supported by many implementations of the standard POSIX
`make` tool) generated from the `Makefile.am` templates by the `automake` tool.

Among the many standard recipes promulgated by the Autotools, `make dist`
handles creation of archive files with a release (or other) snapshot of a
software project, which "distribute" all the original or generated files
needed to build and install that project on a minimally capable end-user
system (should have a compiler, `make`, and dependency libraries/headers,
but is not required to have autotools, manual page generation tools, etc.)

The `make distcheck` goal allows to validate that the constructed archive
is in fact sufficient for such a build (includes all required files), and
also that the code structure and its recipes properly support out-of-tree
builds (as used on multi-platform and cross-build environments) without
contaminating the source code directory structure.

NUT's root `Makefile.am` defines the `DISTCHECK_FLAGS` eventually passed
to the `configure` script executed as part of `distcheck` validation, and
the default set of the flags requires to build everything.  This in turn
constrains the set of systems where this validation can be performed to
build environments that have all dependency projects installed, have the
documentation generation tools, etc. in order to make sure that for all
files that are compiled or otherwise processed by the build routine, we
actually distribute the sources (implicitly as calculated by programs'
listed sources, or via explicit `EXTRA_DIST` and similar statements)
regardless of features enabled or not to be built in the original run.

To avoid this constraint and allow the relevant `distcheck`-like validation
to happen on environments without "everything and a kitchen sink" installed,
further recipes are defined by NUT, such as:

* `distcheck-light`: does not *require* the optional features to be built,
  but just allow them (using `--with-all=auto --with-ssl=auto --with-doc=auto`
  etc. flags);
* `distcheck-light-man`: similar to the above, but require validation that
  manual pages can all be built (do not build PDF or HTML formats, though);
* `distcheck-fake-man`: for formal validation on systems without documentation
  processing tools used by NUT recipes, populate the distribution archive
  with "PLACEHOLDER" contents of missing pre-generated manual pages (such an
  archive SHOULD NOT be delivered to end-users as a fully functional release),
  so the validation of *recipes* around pre-built documentation installation
  can be performed;
* `distcheck-ci`: based on current build circumstances, dispatch to standard
  strict `distcheck` or to `distcheck-fake-man`.

Other recipes based on this concept are also defined, including:

* `distcheck-valgrind`: build whatever code we can, and do not waste time on
  documentation processing (`--with-all=auto --with-ssl=auto --with-doc=skip`),
  to run the NUT test programs (`make check` in the built environment) through
  the <<CI_VALGRIND,Valgrind>> memory-checking tool.

Valgrind checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[[CI_VALGRIND]]

NUT sources include a helper script and a suppression file which allow
developers and CI alike to easily run built programs through the popular
link:https://valgrind.org/[Valgrind] tool and check for memory leaks,
un-closed file descriptors, and more.

One use-case to cover the population of <<CI_NUT_SELFTESTS,NUT self-test
programs>> (and the common code they pull in from NUT libraries and drivers)
is automated as the `make distcheck-valgrind` goal.

cppcheck
~~~~~~~~
[[CI_cppcheck]]

The root `Makefile.am` includes a recipe to run a special build of NUT
analyzed by the `cppcheck` tool (if detected by `configure` script) and
produce a `cppcheck.xml` report for further tools to use, e.g. visualize
it by the Jenkins Warnings plugin.

Static analysis by compilers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[[CI_compiler_warnings]]

As compilers like GCC and LLVM/CLANG evolve, so do their built-in code
analyzers and warnings.  In fact, this is a large part of the reasoning
behind using a vast array of systems along with the compilers they have
(many points of view on the same code discover different issues in it),
and on another -- behind the certain complexity pattern in NUT's own code
base, where code recommended by one compiler seems offensive to another
(so stacks of `pragma` expressions are used to quiesce certain warnings
around certain lines).

Pre-set warning options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The options chosen into pre-sets that can be selected by `configure`
script options are ones we use for different layers of CI tests.

Values to note include:

* `--enable-Werror(=yes/no)` -- make warnings fatal;

* `--enable-warnings(=.../no)` -- enable certain warning presets:

** `gcc-hard`, `clang-hard`, `gcc-medium`, `clang-medium`, `gcc-minimal`,
`clang-minimal`, `all` -- actual definitions that are compiler-dependent
(the latter just adds `-Wall` which may be relatively portable);

** `hard`, `medium` or `minimal` -- if current compiler is detected as
CLANG or GCC, apply corresponding setting from above (or `all` otherwise);

** `gcc` or `clang` -- apply the set of options (regardless of detected
compiler) with default "difficulty" hard-coded in `configure` script,
to tweak as our codebase becomes cleaner;

** `yes`/`auto` (also takes effect if `--enable-warnings` is requested
without an `=ARG` part) -- if current compiler is detected as CLANG
or GCC, apply corresponding setting with default "difficulty" from
above (or `all` otherwise).

Note that for backwards-compatibility reasons and to help filter out
introduction of blatant errors, builds with compilers that claim GCC
compatibility can enable a few easy warning presets by default. This
can be avoided with an explicit argument to `--disable-warnings` (or
`--enable-warnings=no`).

All levels of warnings pre-sets for GCC in particular do not enforce
the `-pedantic` mode for builds with C89/C90/ANSI standard revision
(as guesstimated by `CFLAGS` content), because nowadays it complains
more about the system and third-party library headers, than about NUT
codebase quality (and "our offenses" are mostly something not worth
fixing in this era, such as the use of `__func__` in debug commands).
If there still are practical use-cases that require builds of NUT on
pre-C99 compiler toolkits, pull requests are of course welcome -- but
the maintainer team does not intend to spend much time on that.

Hopefully this warnings pre-set mechanism is extensible enough if we
would need to add more compilers and/or "difficulty levels" in the
future.

Finally, note that such pre-set warnings can be mixed with options
passed through `CFLAGS` or `CXXFLAGS` values to your local `configure`
run, but it is up to your compiler how it interprets the resulting mix.

Shell script checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[[CI_shellcheck]]

The `make shellcheck` recipe finds files which the `file` tool determines
to be POSIX or Bourne-Again shell scripts, and runs them through respective
interpreter's (`bash` or system `/bin/sh`) test mode to validate the syntax
works.

Given that the `/bin/sh` implementation varies wildly on different systems
(e.g. Korn shell, BASH, DASH and many others), this goal performed by CI on
a large number of available platforms makes sure that the lowest-denominator
syntax we use is actually understood everywhere.

NOTE: At a later time additional tests, perhaps using the `shellcheck` tool,
can be introduced into the stack.

The `make shellcheck-nde` recipe calls `tests/nut-driver-enumerator-test.sh`
to self-test the `scripts/upsdrvsvcctl/nut-driver-enumerator.sh.in` against
an array of `SHELL_PROGS` (e.g. a list of interpreters provided by specific
CI agents), and make sure that shell-script based processing of `ups.conf`
in various interpreters provides the exact spelling of expected results.

Documentation spelling checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[[CI_spellcheck]]

NUT recipes rely on the `aspell` tool (with `aspell-en` dictionary, default
but different on numerous platforms), and a custom maintained dictionary file
(specified in `Makefile` variables as `NUT_SPELL_DICT` -- by default, it is
`${top_srcdir}/docs/nut.dict`) for additional words either unique to NUT or
quite common but absent in older standard dictionaries on some systems.
Operations are done according to `LANG` and `LC_ALL` values, both specified
in `Makefile` variables as `ASPELL_ENV_LANG`, by default `en.UTF-8`.

The "nut-website" generation has similar recipes and relies on integration
with those provided by the main NUT code base, but maintains its own custom
dictionary for words only present in the website sources.

The root `Makefile.am` includes recipes which allow developers and maintainers
to check spelling of all documentation (and/or update the custom dictionary),
while recipes in numerous subdirectories (where `README.adoc` or other specific
documentation files exist) have similar goals to check just their files.

The actual implementation of the goals is in `docs/Makefile.am`, and either
calls the tool if it was detected by the `configure` script, or skips work.

For each checked file, a `*-spellchecked` touch-file is created in respective
`${builddir}`, so it is not re-checked until the source document, the custom
dictionary, or the `Makefile` recipe is updated.

The ecosystem of `Makefile.am` files includes the following useful recipes:

* `spellcheck`: passively check that all used words are in some dictionary
  known to this system, or report errors for unknown words;
* `spellcheck-interactive`: actively check the documents, and for unknown
  words start the interactive mode of `aspell` so you can either edit the
  source text (replace typos with suggested correct spelling), update the
  custom dictionary, or ignore the hit (to rephrase the paragraph later, etc.)
+
NOTE: This recipe can update the timestamp of the custom dictionary file,
causing all documents to become fair game for re-checks of their spelling.
* `spellcheck-sortdict`: make sure the custom dictionary file is sorted
  alphanumerically (helpful in case of manual edits) and the word count
  in the heading line is correct (helpful in case of manual edits or git
  branch merges).

The root `Makefile.am` also provides some aids for maintainers:

* `spellcheck-interactive-quick`: runs "passive" `spellcheck` in parallel
  `make` mode, and only if it errors out -- runs `spellcheck-interactive`;
* `spellcheck-report-dict-usage`: prepares a `nut.dict.usage-report` file
  to validate that words used in a custom dictionary are actually present
  in any NUT documentation source file.

Continuous Integration (NUT CI farm) technologies
-------------------------------------------------
[[NUTCI_farm_technologies]]

CI Farm configuration notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[[CI_Farm_Notes]]

NOTE: This chapter contains information about NUT CI farm setup tricks
that were applied at different times by the maintainer team to ensure
regular builds and tests of the codebase.  Whether these are used in
daily production today or not, similar setup should be possible locally
on developer and contributor machines.

Multiple FOSS CI providers and technologies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While there are many FOSS-friendly CI offerings, they are usually (and
reasonably) focused on the OS market leaders -- offering recent releases
of Linux, Windows and MacOS build agents, and sometimes a way to "bring
your own device" to cover other systems.  The NUT CI farm does benefit
from those offerings as well, using GitHub Actions with CodeQL for Linux
code quality inspection, AppVeyor CI for Windows, and CircleCI for MacOS,
to name a few.

But on the other hand, being a massively multi-platform effort (and aiming
to support older boxes that are still alive even if their vendors and/or
distro versions are not), a comprehensive NUT CI approach requires many
machines running uncommon operating systems.  This is where custom virtual
machines help, and more so -- a core set of those hosted in the cloud and
dedicated to the project, rather than only some resources intermittently
contributed by community members which come and go.

NOTE: Community-provided builders running on further systems are also
welcome, and the option is of course supported, as managed by the
link:https://github.com/networkupstools/jenkins-dynamatrix[Jenkins-Dynamatrix]
effort which appeared due to such need, and runs the core NUT CI farm.

We have also had historic experience with FOSS CI providers (and community
members' machines) disappearing, so having NUT CI farm goals covered by
multiple independent implementations is also a feature beyond having yet
another set of digital eyes looking at our code quality (which is also a
goal in itself).

Jenkins is the way

The jenkins-dynamatrix library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[[Jenkins_Dynamatrix_Library]]

FIXME: Write the chapter text.

For now, see https://github.com/networkupstools/jenkins-dynamatrix sources
(note the README and large comments at start of files may be obsolete, as
of this writing -- documenting the initial ideas, but the implementation
might differ from that over time).

Jenkinsfile-dynamatrix cases in NUT sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[[Jenkins_Dynamatrix_Pipeline]]

FIXME: Write the chapter text.

For now, see the `Jenkinsfile-dynamatrix` in the NUT sources (maybe only git),
e.g. https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/blob/master/Jenkinsfile-dynamatrix
for the practical pipeline preparation and hand-off to library implementation.

Jenkins CI
^^^^^^^^^^
[[NUT_CI_JENKINS]]

Since mid-2021, the NUT CI farm is implemented by several virtual servers
courteously provided originally by link:http://fosshost.org[Fosshost] and
later by
link:https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d2fbf2b9e082&utm_campaign=Referral_Invite&utm_medium=Referral_Program&utm_source=badge[DigitalOcean].

These run various operating systems as build agents, and a Jenkins instance
to orchestrate the builds of NUT branches and pull requests on those agents.

This is driven by `Jenkinsfile-dynamatrix` and a Jenkins Shared Library called
link:https://github.com/networkupstools/jenkins-dynamatrix[jenkins-dynamatrix]
which prepares a matrix of builds across as many operating systems,
bitnesses/architectures, compilers, make programs and C/C++ revisions
as it can -- based on the population of currently available build agents
and capabilities which they expose as agent labels.

This hopefully means that people interested in NUT can contribute to the
build farm (and ensure NUT is and remains compatible with their platform)
by running a Jenkins Swarm agent with certain labels, which would dial
into https://ci.networkupstools.org/ controller. Please contact the NUT
maintainer if you want to participate in this manner.

The `Jenkinsfile-dynamatrix` recipe allows NUT CI farm to run different sets
of build scenarios based on various conditions, such as the name of branch
being built (or PR'ed against), changed files (e.g. C/C++ sources vs. just
docs), and some build combinations may be not required to succeed.

For example, the main development branch and pull requests against it must
cleanly pass all specified builds and tests on various platforms with the
default level of warnings specified in the `configure` script. These are
balanced to not run too many build scenarios overall, but just a quick and
sufficiently representative set.

As another example, there is special handling for "fightwarn" pattern in
the branch names to run many more builds with varying warning levels and
more variants of intermediate language revisions, and so expose concerns
deliberately missed by default warnings levels in "master" branch builds
(the bar moves over time, as some classes of warnings become extinct from
our codebase).

Further special handling for branches named like `fightwarn.*89.*` regex
enables more intensive warning levels for a GNU89 build specifically (which
are otherwise disabled as noisy yet not useful for supported C99+ builds),
and is intended to help develop fixes for support of this older language
revision, if anyone would dare.

Many of those unsuccessful build stages are precisely the focus of the
"fightwarn" effort, and are currently marked as "may fail", so they end
up as "UNSTABLE" (seen as orange bubbles in the Jenkins BlueOcean UI, or
orange cells in the tabular list of stages in the legacy UI), rather than
as "FAILURE" (red bubbles) for build scenarios that were not expected to
fail and usually represent higher-priority problems that would block a PR.

Developers whose PR builds (or attempts to fix warnings) did not succeed in
some cell of such build matrix, can look at the individual logs of that cell.
Beside indication from the compiler about the failure, the end of log text
includes the command which was executed by CI worker and can be reproduced
locally by the developer, e.g.:
----
22:26:01  FINISHED with exit-code 2 cmd:  (
22:26:01  [ -x ./ci_build.sh ] || exit
22:26:01
22:26:01  eval BUILD_TYPE="default-alldrv" BUILD_WARNOPT="hard" \
    BUILD_WARNFATAL="yes" MAKE="make"  CC=gcc-10 CXX=g++-10 \
    CPP=cpp-10 CFLAGS='-std=gnu99 -m64' CXXFLAGS='-std=gnu++11 -m64' \
    LDFLAGS='-m64' ./ci_build.sh
22:26:01  )
----
or for autotools-driven scenarios (which prep, configure, build and test
in separate stages -- so for reproducing a failed build you should also
look at its configuration step separately):
----
22:28:18  FINISHED with exit-code 0 cmd:  ( [ -x configure ] || exit; \
    eval  CC=clang-9 CXX=clang++-9 CPP=clang-cpp-9 CFLAGS='-std=c11 -m64' \
    CXXFLAGS='-std=c++11 -m64' LDFLAGS='-m64' time ./configure )
----

To re-run such scenario locally, you can copy the line from `eval` (but
without the `eval` keyword itself) up to and including the executed script
or tool, into your shell. Depending on locally available compilers, you
may have to tweak the `CC`, `CXX` and `CPP` arguments; note that a `CPP`
may be specified as `/path/to/CC -E` for GCC and CLANG based toolkits
at least, if they lack a standalone preprocessor program (e.g. IntelCC).

NOTE: While NUT recipes do not currently recognize a separate `CXXCPP`,
it would follow similar semantics.

Some further details about the NUT CI farm workers are available in
linkdoc:qa-guide[Prerequisites for building NUT on
different OSes,NUT_Config_Prereqs,docs/config-prereqs.txt] and

containers,CI_LXC,docs/ci-farm-lxc-setup.txt] documentation.

AppVeyor CI
~~~~~~~~~~~
[[NUT_CI_APPVEYOR]]

Primarily used for building NUT for Windows on Windows instances provided
in the cloud -- and so ensure non-regression as well as downloadable archives
with binary installation prototype area, intended for enthusiastic testing
(proper packaging to follow). NUT for Windows build-ability was re-introduced
soon after NUT 2.8.0 release.

This relies on a few prerequisite packages and a common NUT configuration,
as coded in the `appveyor.yml` file in the NUT codebase.

CircleCI
~~~~~~~~
[[NUT_CI_CIRCLE]]

Primarily used for building NUT for MacOS on instances provided in the cloud,
and so ensure non-regression across several Xcode releases.

This relies on a few prerequisite packages and a common NUT configuration,
as coded in the `.circleci/config.yml` file in the NUT codebase.

CodeQL
~~~~~~
[[NUT_CI_CODEQL]]

(Earlier this role was performed by LGTM.com) Run GitHub Actions for static
analysis of C, C++ and Python code and recipes, to produce suggestions based
on common coding flaws and best-practice security patterns.

Travis CI
~~~~~~~~~
[[NUT_CI_TRAVIS]]

See the `.travis.yml` file in project sources for a detailed list of third
party dependencies and a large matrix of `CFLAGS` and compiler versions
last known to work or to not (yet) work on operating systems available
to that CI solution.

[NOTE]
======
The cloud Travis CI offering became effectively defunct for
open-source projects in mid-2021, so the `.travis.yml` file in NUT
codebase is not actively maintained.

Local private deployments of Travis CI are possible, so if anybody does
use it and has updated markup to share, they are welcome to post PRs.
======

The NUT project on GitHub had integration with Travis CI to test a large
set of compiler and option combinations, covering different versions of
gcc and clang, C standards, and requiring to pass builds at least in a
mode without warnings (and checking the other cases where any warnings
are made fatal).

Open Build Service (OBS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[[NUT_CI_OBS]]

The SuSE-backed software suite and on-line instance of the Open Build
Service (OBS) allows building packages for a wide range of Linux (and
potentially non-Linux) operating system distributions.

This can be seen as an additional CI test for multi-platform portability,
but mainly allows NUT users to get recent development builds as "proper"
packages.

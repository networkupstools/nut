There are a few options that can be given to configure to tweak compiles. 
See also "./configure --help" for a current and complete listing.

Contents:
=========

1. Driver selection
2. Optional features
3. Other configuration options
4. Installation directories
5. Directories used by NUT at run-time
6. Things the compiler might need to find

1. Driver selection:
====================

 --with-serial

   Build and install the serial drivers (default: yes)

 --with-usb

   Build and install the USB drivers (default: auto-detect)
   Note that you need to install the libusb development package or files.

 --with-snmp

   Build and install the SNMP drivers (default: auto-detect)
   Note that you need to install libsnmp development package or files.

 --with-drivers=<driver>,<driver>,...

   Specify exactly which driver or drivers to build and install (this
   works for serial, usb, and snmp drivers, and overrides the
   preceding three options).

   As of the time of this writing (2006), there are 47 UPS drivers
   available.  Most users will only need one, a few will need two or
   three, and very few people will need all of them.

   To save time during the compile and disk space later on, you can
   use this option to just build and install a subset of the drivers.
   To select apcsmart and usbhid-ups, you'd do this:

	--with-drivers=apcsmart,usbhid-ups

   If you need to build more drivers later on, you will need to rerun
   configure with a different list. To make it build all of the
   drivers from scratch again, run 'make clean' before starting.

2. Optional features:
=====================

 --with-cgi (default: no)

   Build and install the optional CGI programs, HTML files, and sample
   CGI configuration files. This is not enabled by default, as they
   are only useful on web servers. See data/html/README for additional
   information on how to set up CGI programs.

 --with-lib (default: no)

   Build and install the upsclient library and header files. 

 --with-all (no default)

   Build and install all of the above (the serial, USB, and SNMP
   drivers, the CGI programs and HTML files, and the upsclient
   library).

  --with-ssl

   Enable SSL development code (default: auto-detect)

  --with-ipv6

   Enable IPv6 support (default: auto-detect)

  --with-hal (default: no)

    Build and install Hardware Abstraction Layer support.
    If you own a USB unit, only protect your local system and run the
    Gnome or KDE desktop, this will enable a full Plug & Play usage.
    See docs/nut-hal.txt for additional information on how to set up
    and use HAL support.
 
  --with-powerman  (default: auto-detect)

    Build and install Powerman PDU client driver.
    This allows to interact with the Powerman daemon, and the numerous
    Power Distribution Units (PDU) supported by the project.
 
3. Other configuration options:
===============================

 --with-port=PORT

   Change the TCP port used by the network code.  Default is 3493.

   Ancient versions of upsd used port 3305.  NUT 2.0 and up use a
   substantially different network protocol and are not able to  
   communicate with anything older than the 1.4 series.

   If you have to monitor a mixed environment, use the last 1.4 version,
   as it contains compatibility code for both the old "REQ" and the new
   "GET" versions of the protocol.

 --with-user=<username>
 --with-group=<groupname>

   Programs started as root will setuid() to <username> for somewhat
   safer operation.  You can override this with -u <user> in several
   programs, including upsdrvctl (and all drivers by extension), upsd,
   and upsmon.  The "user" directive in ups.conf overrides this at run
   time for the drivers.

   Note: upsmon does not totally drop root because it may need to
   initiate a shutdown.  There is always at least a stub process
   remaining with root powers.  The network code runs in another
   (separate) process as the new user.

   The <groupname> is used for the permissions of some files,
   particularly the hotplugging rules for USB. The idea is that the
   device files for any UPS devices should be readable and writable by
   members of that group.

   The default value for both the username and groupname is "nobody".
   This was done since it's slightly better than staying around as
   root.  Running things as nobody is not a good idea, since it's a
   hack for NFS access.  You should create at least one separate user
   for this software.

   If you use one of the --with-user and --with-group options, then
   you have to use the other one too. 

   See the INSTALL document and the FAQ for more on this topic.

 --with-logfacility=FACILITY

   Change the facility used when writing to the log file.  Read the man
   page for openlog to get some idea of what's available on your system.
   Default is LOG_DAEMON.

4. Installation directories:
============================

 --prefix=PATH

   This is a fairly standard option with GNU autoconf, and it sets the
   base path for most of the other install directories.  The default
   is /usr/local/ups, which puts everything but the state sockets in one
   easy place.

   If you like having things to be at more of a "system" level, setting
   the prefix to /usr/local or even /usr might be better.

 --exec_prefix=PATH

   This sets the base path for architecture dependent files. By
   default, it is the same as <prefix>.

 --sysconfdir=PATH

   Changes the location where NUT's configuration files are stored.
   By default this path is <prefix>/etc.  Setting this to /etc or
   /etc/ups might be useful.

   The NUT_CONFPATH environment variable overrides this at run time.

 --bindir=PATH
 --sbindir=PATH

   Where executable files will be installed. Files that are normally
   executed by root (upsd, upsmon, upssched) go to sbindir, all others
   to bindir. The defaults are <exec_prefix>/bin and <exec_prefix>/sbin.

 --datadir=PATH

   Change the data directory, i.e., where architecture independent
   read-only data is installed.  By default this is <prefix>/share,
   i.e., /usr/local/ups/share.  At the moment, this directory only
   holds two files - the optional cmdvartab and driver.list.

 --mandir=PATH

   Sets the base directories for the man pages.  The default is
   <prefix>/man, i.e., /usr/local/ups/man.

 --includedir=PATH

   Sets the path for include files to be installed when --with-lib is
   selected. For example, upsclient.h is installed here. The default
   is <prefix>/include.

 --libdir=PATH

   Sets the installation path for libraries.  This is just the
   upsclient library for now.  The default is <exec_prefix>/lib.

 --with-drvpath=PATH

   The UPS drivers will be installed to this path.  By default they
   install to "<exec_prefix>/bin", i.e., /usr/local/ups/bin.

   The "driverpath" global directive in the ups.conf file overrides this
   at run time.

 --with-cgipath=PATH

   The CGI programs will be installed to this path.  By default, they
   install to "<exec_prefix>/cgi-bin", which is usually /usr/local/ups/cgi-bin.

   If you set the prefix to something like /usr, you should set the 
   cgipath to something else, because /usr/cgi-bin is pretty ugly and 
   non-standard.

   The CGI programs are not built or installed by default.  Use
   "./configure --with-cgi" to request that they are built and
   installed.

 --with-htmlpath=PATH

   HTML files will be installed to this path. By default, this is
   "<prefix>/html". Note that HTML files are only installed if
   --with-cgi is selected.

 --with-pkgconfig-dir=PATH

   Where to install pkg-config *.pc files. This option only has an
   effect if --with-lib is selected, and causes a pkg-config file to
   be installed in the named location. The default is
   <exec_prefix>/pkgconfig.

   Use --without-pkgconfig-dir to disable this feature altogether. 

 --with-hotplug-dir=PATH

   Where to install Linux 2.4 hotplugging rules. The default is
   /etc/hotplug, if that directory exists, and not to install it
   otherwise. Note that this installation directory is not a
   subdirectory of <prefix> by default. When installing NUT as a
   non-root user, you may have to override this option.

   Use --without-hotplug-dir to disable this feature altogether. 

 --with-udev-dir=PATH

   Where to install Linux 2.6 hotplugging rules, for kernels that have
   the "udev" mechanism. The default is /etc/udev, if that directory
   exists, and not to install it otherwise. Note that this
   installation directory is not a subdirectory of <prefix> by
   default. When installing NUT as a non-root user, you may have to
   override this option.

   Use --without-udev-dir to disable this feature altogether. 

5. Directories used by NUT at run-time:
=======================================

 --with-pidpath=PATH

   Changes the directory where pid files are stored.  By default this is
   /var/run.  Certain programs like upsmon will leave files here.

 --with-altpidpath=PATH

   Programs that normally don't have root powers, like the drivers and
   upsd, write their pid files here.  By default this is whatever the
   statepath is, as those programs should be able to write there.

 --with-statepath=PATH

   Change the default location of the state sockets created by the
   drivers.

   The NUT_STATEPATH environment variable overrides this at run time.

   Default is /var/state/ups.

6. Things the compiler might need to find:
==========================================

 --with-gd-includes="-I/foo/bar"

   If you installed gd in some place where your C preprocessor can't
   find the header files, use this switch to add additional -I flags.

 --with-gd-libs="-L/foo/bar -labcd -lxyz"

   If your copy of gd isn't linking properly, use this to give the
   proper -L and -l flags to make it work.  See LIBS= in gd's Makefile.

   Note: the --with-gd switches are not necessary if you have gd 2.0.8
   or higher installed properly.  The gdlib-config script will be 
   detected and used by default in that situation.

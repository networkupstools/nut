Introduction
============

The primary goal of the Network UPS Tools (NUT) project is to provide support
for Power Devices, such as Uninterruptible Power Supplies, Power Distribution
Units and Solar Controllers.

NUT provides many control and monitoring <<Features,features>>, with a uniform
control and management interface.

More than 170 different manufacturers, and several thousands of models are
<<HCL,compatible>>.

This software is the combined effort of many
<<Acknowledgements,individuals and companies>>.

This document intend to describe how to install software support for your
<<general_powerdev_info, Power Devices>> (UPS, PDU, ...), and how to use the
NUT project. It is not intended to explain what are, nor distinguish the
different technologies that exist.  For such information, have a look at the
<<general_powerdev_info,General Power Devices Information>>.

If you wish to discover how everything came together, have a look at the

Compatibility information
-------------------------

Hardware
~~~~~~~~

The current list of hardware supported by NUT can be viewed <<HCL,here>>.

Operating systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This software has been reported to run on:

- Linux distributions,
- the BSDs,
- Apple's OS X,
- Sun Solaris and illumos,
- SGI IRIX,
- HP/UX,
- Tru64 Unix,
- AIX,
- Windows:
  * There is an older port of the client-side monitoring to Windows called WinNUT.
    Windows users may be able to build it directly with Cygwin.
  * Note there are also numerous third-party projects named WinNUT-Client or
    similar, made over decades by different enthusiasts and community members
    with a number of technologies underneath. If you run a program that claims
    such a name, locate and ask its creators for support related to the client.
  * Since NUT v2.8.1, there is an on-going effort to integrate older platform
    development of NUT for Windows into the main code base -- allowing to run
    the whole stack of NUT drivers, data server and clients. Still, as of NUT
    release v2.8.3, installation is complicated and there are other known
    imperfections (not all WIN32 code has equivalents to POSIX), tracked under
    https://github.com/orgs/networkupstools/projects/2/views/1

NUT is also often embedded into third-party projects like OpenWRT (or similar)
based routers, NAS and other appliances, monitoring systems like Home Assistant,
and provided or suggested by some UPS vendors as their software companion.

Your system will probably run it too. You just need a good C compiler and
possibly some more packages to gain access to the serial ports.
Other features, such as USB / SNMP / whatever, will also need extra software
installed.

Success reports are welcomed to keep this list accurate.

Given its core position at the heart of your systems' lifecycle, we make
it a point to have current NUT building and running anywhere, especially
where older releases did work before (including "abandonware" like the
servers and OSes from the turn of millennium): if those boxes are still
alive and in need of power protection, they should be able to get it.

[TIP]
=====
If you like how the NUT project helps protect your systems from power
outages, please consider sponsoring or at least "starring" it on GitHub at
https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/ - these stars are among metrics
which the larger potential sponsors consider when choosing how to help
FOSS projects. Keeping the lights shining in such a large non-regression
build matrix is a big undertaking!

endif::pdf_format[]

See <<acknowledgements-ci-ops,acknowledgements of organizations which help
with NUT CI and other daily operations>> for an overview of the shared effort.
=====

As a FOSS project, for over a quarter of a century we welcome contributions
of both core code (drivers and other features), build recipes and other
integration elements to make it work on your favourite system, documentation
revisions to make it more accessible to newcomers, as well as hardware vendor
cooperation with first-hand driver and protocol submissions, and just about
anything else you can think of.


NUT Support Policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Network UPS Tools project is a community-made open-source effort, primarily
made and maintained by people donating their spare time.

The support channels are likewise open, with preferred ones being
link:https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues[the NUT project issue
tracker on GitHub] and the NUT Users mailing list, as detailed at
https://networkupstools.org/support.html page.

Please keep in mind that any help is provided by community members just like
yourself, as a best effort, and subject to their availability and experience.
It is expected that you have read the Frequently Asked Questions, looked at
the link:https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/wiki[NUT wiki], and have a
good grasp about the three-layer design and programs involved in a running
deployment of NUT, for a discussion to be constructive and efficient.

Be patient, polite, and prepare to learn and provide information about your
NUT deployment (version, configuration, OS...) and the device, to collect
logs, and to answer any follow-up questions about your situation.

Finally, note that NUT is packaged and delivered by packaging into numerous
operating systems, appliances and monitoring projects, and may be bundled
with third-party GUI clients.  It may be wise of end-users to identify such
cases and ask for help on the most-relevant forum (or several, including the
NUT support channels).  It is important to highlight that the NUT project
releases have for a long time been essentially snapshots of better-tested
code, and we do not normally issue patches to "hot-fix" any older releases.

Any improvements of NUT itself are made in the current code base, same as
any other feature development, so to receive desired fixes on your system
(and/or to check that they do solve your particular issue), expect to be
asked to build the recent development iteration from GitHub or work with
your appliance vendor to get a software upgrade.

Over time, downstream OS packaging or other integrations which use NUT, may
issue patches as new package revisions, or new baseline versions of NUT,
according to *their* release policies. It is not uncommon for distributions,
especially "stable" flavours, to be a few years behind upstream projects.

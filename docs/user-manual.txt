Introduction
============

The primary goal of the Network UPS Tools (NUT) project is to provide support
for Power Devices, such as Uninterruptible Power Supplies, Power Distribution
Units and Solar Controllers.

NUT provides many control and monitoring <<Features,features>>, with a uniform
control and management interface.

More than 140 different manufacturers, and several thousands of models are
<<HCL,compatible>>.

This software is the combined effort of many
<<Acknowledgements,individuals and companies>>.

This document intend to describe how to install software support for your
<<general_powerdev_info, Power Devices>> (UPS, PDU, ...), and how to use the
NUT project. It is not intended to explain what are, nor distinguish the
different technologies that exist.  For such information, have a look at the
<<general_powerdev_info,General Power Devices Information>>.

If you wish to discover how everything came together, have a look at the
<<Project_History,Project History>>.

Compatibility information
-------------------------

Hardware
~~~~~~~~

The current list of hardware supported by NUT can be viewed <<HCL,here>>.

Operating systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This software has been reported to run on:

- Linux distributions,
- the BSDs,
- Apple's OS X,
- Sun Solaris,
- SGI IRIX,
- HP/UX,
- Tru64 Unix,
- AIX.

There is also a port of the client-side monitoring to Windows called WinNUT.
Windows users may be able to build it directly with Cygwin.

Your system will probably run it too. You just need a good C compiler and
possibly some more packages to gain access to the serial ports.
Other features, such as USB / SNMP / whatever, will also need extra software
installed.

Success reports are welcomed to keep this list accurate.

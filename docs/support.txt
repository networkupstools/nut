There are various ways to obtain support for NUT.

Documentation
-------------

- First, be sure to read the link:docs/FAQ.html[FAQ]. The most common
problems are already addressed there.

It also covers many areas about installing, configuring and using NUT.
The specific steps on system integration are also discussed.

- Finally, link:docs/man/index.html#User_man[User manual pages] will also
complete the User Manual provided information. At least, read the manual
page related to your driver(s).

Mailing lists
-------------

If you have still not found a solution, you should search the lists before
posting a question.

Someone may have already solved the problem:

Finally, you can *subscribe* to a NUT mailing list to:

Request help
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the link:http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/nut-upsuser[NUT Users]
mailing list.

In this case, be sure to include the following information:

- OS name and version,
- exact NUT version,
- NUT installation method: package, or a custom build from source tarball
  or GitHub (which fork, branch, PR),
- exact device name and related information (manufacturing date, web
  pointers, ...),
- complete problem description, with any relevant traces, like system
  log excerpts, and driver debug output. You can obtain the latter using
  the following command, running as root and after having stopped NUT:

	/path/to/driver -DD -a <upsname>

If you don't include the above information in your help request, we will
not be able to help you!

Post a patch, ask a development question, ...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the link:http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/nut-upsdev[NUT Developers]
mailing list.

Refer to the
ifdef::website[]
link:docs/developer-guide.chunked/index.html[NUT Developer Guide]
for more information, and the chapter on how to
link:docs/developer-guide.chunked/ar01s03.html#_submitting_patches[submit patches].

linkdoc:developer-guide[NUT Developer Guide]
for more information, and the chapter on how to

endif::website[]

Note that the currently preferable way for ultimate submission of improvements
is to link:https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/pulls[post a pull request]
from your GitHub fork of NUT. Benefits of PRs include automated testing and
merge-conflict detection and resolution, as well as tracking discussion that
is often needed to better understand, integrate or document the patch.

Discuss packaging and related topics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the link:http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/nut-packaging[NUT Packagers]
mailing list.

 for more information.


IRC (Internet Relay Chat)
-------------------------

Yes, we're open!

There is an official `#nut` channel on https://libera.chat/ network.

Feel free to hang out with whoever is on-line at the moment, or watch reports
from the NUT CI farm as they come.

Please don't forget the basics of netiquette, such as that any help is done
on a best-effort basis, people have other obligations, and are not always
there even if their chat client is, and that respect and politeness are the
norm (this includes doing some research before asking, and explaining the
context where it is not trivial).


GitHub Issues
-------------

See https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues for another venue of
asking (and answering) questions, as well as proposing improvements.

To report new Devices Dumps Library entries, posting an issue is okay, but
posting a link:https://github.com/networkupstools/nut-ddl/pulls[pull request]
is a lot better -- easier for maintainers to review and merge any time.
For some more detailed instructions about useful DDL reports, please see
link:https://networkupstools.org/ddl/#_file_naming_convention[NUT DDL page].

Setting up the multi-arch Linux LXC container farm for NUT CI
-------------------------------------------------------------

Due to some historical reasons including earlier personal experience,
the Linux container setup implemented as described below was done with
persistent LXC containers wrapped by LIBVIRT for management. There was
no particular use-case for systems like Docker (and no firepower for a
Kubernetes cluster) in that the build environment intended for testing
non-regression against a certain release does not need to be regularly
updated -- its purpose is to be stale and represent what users still
running that system for whatever reason (e.g. embedded, IoT, corporate)
have in their environments.

Common preparations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Example list of packages for Debian-based systems may include (not
  necessarily is limited to):
+
----
:; apt install lxc lxcfs lxc-templates \
    ipxe-qemu qemu-kvm qemu-system-common qemu-system-data \
    qemu-system-sparc qemu-system-x86 qemu-user-static qemu-utils \
    virt-manager virt-viewer virtinst ovmf \
    libvirt-daemon-system-systemd libvirt-daemon-system \
    libvirt-daemon-driver-lxc libvirt-daemon-driver-qemu \
    libvirt-daemon-config-network libvirt-daemon-config-nwfilter \
    libvirt-daemon libvirt-clients

# TODO: Where to find virt-top - present in some but not all releases?
# Can fetch sources from https://packages.debian.org/sid/virt-top and follow
# https://www.linuxfordevices.com/tutorials/debian/build-packages-from-source
# Be sure to use 1.0.x versions, since 1.1.x uses a "better-optimized API"
# which is not implemented by libvirt/LXC backend.
----
+
NOTE: This claims a footprint of over a gigabyte of new packages when
  unpacked and installed to a minimally prepared OS. Much of that would
  be the graphical environment dependencies required by several engines
  and tools.

* Prepare LXC and LIBVIRT-LXC integration, including an "independent"
  (aka "masqueraded) bridge for NAT, following https://wiki.debian.org/LXC
  and https://wiki.debian.org/LXC/SimpleBridge
** For dnsmasq integration on the independent bridge (`lxcbr0` following
   the documentation examples), be sure to mention:
*** `LXC_DHCP_CONFILE="/etc/lxc/dnsmasq.conf"` in `/etc/default/lxc-net`
*** `dhcp-hostsfile=/etc/lxc/dnsmasq-hosts.conf` in/as the content of
    `/etc/lxc/dnsmasq.conf`
*** `touch /etc/lxc/dnsmasq-hosts.conf` which would list simple `name,IP`
    pairs, one per line (so one per container)
*** `systemctl restart lxc-net` to apply config (is this needed after
    setup of containers too, to apply new items before booting them?)
*** For troubleshooting, see `/var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.lxcbr0.leases`
    (in some cases you may have to rename it away and reboot host to
    fix IP address delegation)

* Install qemu with its `/usr/bin/qemu-*-static` and registration in
  `/var/lib/binfmt`

* Prepare an LVM partition (or preferably some other tech like ZFS)
  as `/srv/libvirt` and create a `/srv/libvirt/rootfs` to hold the containers

* Prepare `/home/abuild` on the host system (preferably in ZFS with
  lightweight compression like lz4 -- and optionally, only if the amount
  of available system RAM permits, with deduplication; otherwise avoid it);
  account user and group ID numbers are `399` as on the rest of the CI farm
  (historically, inherited from OBS workers)

** It may help to generate an ssh key without a passphrase for `abuild`
   that it would trust, to sub-login from CI agent sessions into the
   container. Then again, it may be not required if CI logs into the
   host by SSH using `authorized_keys` and an SSH Agent, and the inner
   ssh client would forward that auth channel to the original agent.
+
------
abuild$ ssh-keygen
# accept defaults

abuild$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
abuild$ chmod 640 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
------

* Edit the root (or whoever manages libvirt) `~/.profile` to default the
  virsh provider with:
+
------
LIBVIRT_DEFAULT_URI=lxc:///system
export LIBVIRT_DEFAULT_URI
------

* If host root filesystem is small, relocate the LXC download cache to the
  (larger) `/srv/libvirt` partition:
+
------
:; mkdir -p /srv/libvirt/cache-lxc
:; rm -rf /var/cache/lxc
:; ln -sfr /srv/libvirt/cache-lxc /var/cache/lxc
------
** Maybe similarly relocate shared `/home/abuild` to reduce strain on rootfs?


Setup a container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that completeness of qemu CPU emulation varies, so not all distros
can be installed, e.g. "s390x" failed for both debian10 and debian11 to
set up the `openssh-server` package, or once even to run `/bin/true` (seems
to have installed an older release though, to match the outdated emulation?)

While the `lxc-create` tool does not really specify the error cause and
deletes the directories after failure, it shows the pathname where it
writes the log (also deleted). Before re-trying the container creation, this
file can be watched with e.g. `tail -F /var/cache/lxc/.../debootstrap.log`

[NOTE]
======
You can find the list of LXC "template" definitions on your system
by looking at the contents of the `/usr/share/lxc/templates/` directory,
e.g. a script named `lxc-debian` for the "debian" template. You can see
further options for each "template" by invoking its help action, e.g.:
------
:; lxc-create -t debian -h
------
======

Initial container installation (for various guest OSes)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Install containers like this:
+
------
:; lxc-create -P /srv/libvirt/rootfs \
    -n jenkins-debian11-mips64el -t debian -- \
    -r bullseye -a mips64el
------
** to specify a particular mirror (not everyone hosts everything --
   so if you get something like
   `"E: Invalid Release file, no entry for main/binary-mips/Packages"`
   then see https://www.debian.org/mirror/list for details, and double-check
   the chosen site to verify if the distro version of choice is hosted with
   your arch of choice):
+
------
:; MIRROR="http://ftp.br.debian.org/debian/" \
   lxc-create -P /srv/libvirt/rootfs \
    -n jenkins-debian10-mips -t debian -- \
    -r buster -a mips
------
** ...or for EOLed distros, use the Debian Archive server.
*** Install the container with Debian Archive as the mirror like this:
+
------
:; MIRROR="http://archive.debian.org/debian-archive/debian/" \
   lxc-create -P /srv/libvirt/rootfs \
    -n jenkins-debian8-s390x -t debian -- \
    -r jessie -a s390x
------
*** Note you may have to add trust to their (now expired) GPG keys for
    packaging to verify signatures made at the time the key was valid,
    by un-symlinking (if appropriate) the debootstrap script such as
    `/usr/share/debootstrap/scripts/jessie`, commenting away the
    `keyring /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg` line and
    setting `keyring /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-removed-keys.gpg`
    instead. You may further have to edit `/usr/share/debootstrap/functions`
    and/or `/usr/share/lxc/templates/lxc-debian` to honor that setting (the
    `releasekeyring` was hard-coded in version I had installed), e.g. in the
    latter file ensure such logic as below, and re-run the installation:
+
------
...
    # If debian-archive-keyring isn't installed, fetch GPG keys directly
    releasekeyring="`grep -E '^keyring ' "/usr/share/debootstrap/scripts/$release" | sed -e 's,^keyring ,,' -e 's,[ #].*$,,'`" 2>/dev/null
    if [ -z $releasekeyring ]; then
        releasekeyring=/usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg
    fi
    if [ ! -f $releasekeyring ]; then
...
------
** ...Alternatively, other distributions can be used (as supported by your
   LXC scripts, typically in `/usr/share/debootstrap/scripts`), e.g. Ubuntu:
+
------
:; lxc-create -P /srv/libvirt/rootfs \
    -n jenkins-ubuntu1804-s390x -t ubuntu -- \
    -r bionic -a s390x
------
** For distributions with a different packaging mechanism from that on the
   LXC host system, you may need to install corresponding tools (e.g. `yum4`,
   `rpm` and `dnf` on Debian hosts for installing CentOS and related guests).
   You may also need to pepper with symlinks to taste (e.g. `yum => yum4`),
   or find a `pacman` build to install Arch Linux or derivative, etc.
   Otherwise, you risk seeing something like this:
+
------
root@debian:~# lxc-create -P /srv/libvirt/rootfs \
    -n jenkins-centos7-x86-64 -t centos -- \
    -R 7 -a x86_64

Host CPE ID from /etc/os-release:
'yum' command is missing
lxc-create: jenkins-centos7-x86-64: lxccontainer.c:
  create_run_template: 1616 Failed to create container from template
lxc-create: jenkins-centos7-x86-64: tools/lxc_create.c:
  main: 319 Failed to create container jenkins-centos7-x86-64
------
+
Note also that with such "third-party" distributions you may face other
   issues; for example, the CentOS helper did not generate some fields in
   the `config` file that were needed for conversion into libvirt "domxml"
   (as found by trial and error, and comparison to other `config` files):
+
------
lxc.uts.name = jenkins-centos7-x86-64
lxc.arch = x86_64
------
+
Also note the container/system naming without underscore in "x86_64" --
   the deployed system discards the character when assigning its hostname.
   Using "amd64" is another reasonable choice here.
** For Arch Linux you would need `pacman` tools on the host system, so see
   https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Install_Arch_Linux_from_existing_Linux#Using_pacman_from_the_host_system
   for details.
   On a Debian/Ubuntu host (assumed ready for NUT builds per
   linkdoc:config-prereqs.txt) it would start like this:
+
------
:; apt-get update
:; apt-get install meson ninja-build cmake

# Some dependencies for pacman itself; note there are several libcurl builds;
# pick another if your system constraints require you to:
:; apt-get install libarchive-dev libcurl4-nss-dev gpg libgpgme-dev

:; git clone https://gitlab.archlinux.org/pacman/pacman.git
:; cd pacman

# Iterate something like this until all needed dependencies fall
# into line (note libdir for your host architecture):
:; rm -rf build; mkdir build && meson build --libdir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu

:; ninja -C build
# Depending on your asciidoc version, it may require that `--asciidoc-opts` are
# passed as equation to a vale (not space-separated from it). Then apply this:
#   diff --git a/doc/meson.build b/doc/meson.build
#   -      '--asciidoc-opts', ' '.join(asciidoc_opts),
#   +      '--asciidoc-opts='+' '.join(asciidoc_opts),
# and re-run (meson and) ninja.

# Finally when all succeeded:
:; sudo ninja -C build install
:; cd
------
+
You will also need `pacstrap` and Debian `arch-install-scripts` package
does not deliver it. It is however simply achieved:
------
:; git clone https://github.com/archlinux/arch-install-scripts
:; cd arch-install-scripts
:; make && sudo make PREFIX=/usr install
:; cd
------
+
It will also want an `/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist` which you can populate for
your geographic location from https://archlinux.org/mirrorlist/ service,
or just fetch them all (don't forget to uncomment some `Server =` lines):
------
:; mkdir -p /etc/pacman.d/
:; curl https://archlinux.org/mirrorlist/all/ > /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
------
+
And to reference it from your host `/etc/pacman.conf` by un-commenting the
`[core]` section and `Include` instruction, as well as adding `[community]`
and `[extra]` sections with same reference, e.g.:
------
[core]
### SigLevel = Never
SigLevel = PackageRequired
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

[extra]
### SigLevel = Never
SigLevel = PackageRequired
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

[community]
### SigLevel = Never
SigLevel = PackageRequired
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
------
+
And just then you can proceed with LXC:
------
:; lxc-create -P /srv/libvirt/rootfs \
    -n jenkins-archlinux-amd64 -t archlinux -- \
    -a x86_64 -P openssh,sudo
------
+
In my case, it had problems with GPG keyring missing (using one in host
system, as well as the package cache outside the container, it seems)
so I had to run `pacman-key --init; pacman-key --refresh-keys` on the
host itself. Even so, `lxc-create` complained about updating some keyring
entries and I had to go one by one picking key servers (serving different
metadata) like this:
------
:; pacman-key --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key 6D1655C14CE1C13E
------
+
In the worst case, see `SigLevel = Never` for `pacman.conf` to not check
package integrity (seems too tied into thinking that host OS is Arch)...
+
It seems that pre-fetching the package databases with `pacman -Sy` on
the host was also important.

Initial container-related setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Add the "name,IP" line for this container to `/etc/lxc/dnsmasq-hosts.conf`
  on the host, e.g.:
+
------
jenkins-debian11-mips,10.0.3.245
------
+
NOTE: Don't forget to eventually `systemctl restart lxc-net` to apply the
new host reservation!

* Convert a pure LXC container to be managed by LIBVIRT-LXC (and edit config
  markup on the fly -- e.g. fix the LXC `dir:/` URL schema):
+
------
:; virsh -c lxc:///system domxml-from-native lxc-tools \
    /srv/libvirt/rootfs/jenkins-debian11-armhf/config \
    | sed -e 's,dir:/srv,/srv,' \
    > /tmp/x && virsh define /tmp/x
------
+
NOTE: You may want to tune the default generic 64MB RAM allocation,
   so your launched QEMU containers are not OOM-killed as they exceeded
   their memory `cgroup` limit. In practice they do not eat *that much*
   resident memory, just want to have it addressable by VMM, I guess
   (swap is not very used either), at least not until active builds
   start (and then it depends on compiler appetite and `make` program
   parallelism level you allow, e.g. by pre-exporting `MAXPARMAKES`
   environment variable for `ci_build.sh`, and on the number of Jenkins
   "executors" assigned to the build agent).
+
** It may be needed to revert the generated "os/arch" to `x86_64` (and let
   QEMU handle the rest) in the `/tmp/x` file, and re-try the definition:
+
------
:; virsh define /tmp/x
------

* Then execute `virsh edit jenkins-debian11-armhf` (and same for other
  containers) to bind-mount the common `/home/abuild` location, adding
  this tag to their "devices":
+
------
    <filesystem type='mount' accessmode='passthrough'>
      <source dir='/home/abuild'/>
      <target dir='/home/abuild'/>
    </filesystem>
------
** Note that generated XML might not conform to current LXC schema, so it
   fails validation during save; this can be bypassed with `i` when it asks.
   One such case was however with indeed invalid contents, the "dir:" schema
   removed by example above.


Shepherd the herd
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Monitor deployed container rootfs'es with:
+
------
:; du -ks /srv/libvirt/rootfs/*
------
+
(should have non-trivial size for deployments without fatal infant errors)

* Mass-edit/review libvirt configurations with:
+
------
:; virsh list --all | awk '{print $2}' \
   | grep jenkins | while read X ; do \
     virsh edit --skip-validate $X ; done
------
** ...or avoid `--skip-validate` when markup is initially good :)

* Mass-define network interfaces:
+
------
:; virsh list --all | awk '{print $2}' \
   | grep jenkins | while read X ; do \
     virsh dumpxml "$X" | grep "bridge='lxcbr0'" \
     || virsh attach-interface --domain "$X" --config \
        --type bridge --source lxcbr0 ; \
   done
------

* Verify that unique MAC addresses were defined (e.g. `00:16:3e:00:00:01`
  tends to pop up often, while `52:54:00:xx:xx:xx` are assigned to other
  containers); edit the domain definitions to randomize, if needed:
+
------
:; grep 'mac add' /etc/libvirt/lxc/*.xml | awk '{print $NF" "$1}' | sort
------

* Make sure at least one console device exists (end of file, under the
  network interface definition tags), e.g.:
+
------
    <console type='pty'>
      <target type='lxc' port='0'/>
    </console>
------

* Populate with `abuild` account, as well as with the `bash` shell and
  `sudo` ability, reporting of assigned IP addresses on the console,
  and SSH server access complete with envvar passing from CI clients
  by virtue of `ssh -o SendEnv='*' container-name`:
+
------
:; for ALTROOT in /srv/libvirt/rootfs/*/rootfs/ ; do \
    echo "=== $ALTROOT :" >&2; \
    grep eth0 "$ALTROOT/etc/issue" || ( printf '%s %s\n' \
        '\S{NAME} \S{VERSION_ID} \n \l@\b ;' \
        'Current IP(s): \4{eth0} \4{eth1} \4{eth2} \4{eth3}' \
        >> "$ALTROOT/etc/issue" ) ; \
    grep eth0 "$ALTROOT/etc/issue.net" || ( printf '%s %s\n' \
        '\S{NAME} \S{VERSION_ID} \n \l@\b ;' \
        'Current IP(s): \4{eth0} \4{eth1} \4{eth2} \4{eth3}' \
        >> "$ALTROOT/etc/issue.net" ) ; \
    groupadd -R "$ALTROOT" -g 399 abuild ; \
    useradd -R "$ALTROOT" -u 399 -g abuild -M -N -s /bin/bash abuild \
    || useradd -R "$ALTROOT" -u 399 -g 399 -M -N -s /bin/bash abuild \
    || { if ! grep -w abuild "$ALTROOT/etc/passwd" ; then \
            echo 'abuild:x:399:399::/home/abuild:/bin/bash' \
            >> "$ALTROOT/etc/passwd" ; \
            echo "USERADDed manually: passwd" >&2 ; \
         fi ; \
         if ! grep -w abuild "$ALTROOT/etc/shadow" ; then \
            echo 'abuild:!:18889:0:99999:7:::' >> "$ALTROOT/etc/shadow" ; \
            echo "USERADDed manually: shadow" >&2 ; \
         fi ; \
       } ; \
    if [ -s "$ALTROOT/etc/ssh/sshd_config" ]; then \
        grep 'AcceptEnv \*' "$ALTROOT/etc/ssh/sshd_config" || ( \
            ( echo "" ; \
              echo "# For CI: Allow passing any envvars:"; \
              echo 'AcceptEnv *' ) \
            >> "$ALTROOT/etc/ssh/sshd_config" \
        ) ; \
    fi ; \
   done
------
+
Note that for some reason, in some of those other-arch distros `useradd`
fails to find the group anyway; then we have to "manually" add them.

* Let the host know and resolve the names/IPs of containers you assigned:
+
------
:; grep -v '#' /etc/lxc/dnsmasq-hosts.conf \
   | while IFS=, read N I ; do \
    getent hosts "$N" >&2 || echo "$I $N" ; \
   done >> /etc/hosts
------

Further setup of the containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See NUT `docs/config-prereqs.txt` about dependency package installation
for Debian-based Linux systems.

It may be wise to not install e.g. documentation generation tools (or at
least not the full set for HTML/PDF generation) in each environment, in
order to conserve space and run-time stress.

Still, if there are significant version outliers (such as using an older
distribution due to vCPU requirements), it can be installed fully just
to ensure non-regression -- e.g. that when adapting `Makefile` rule
definitions or compiler arguments to modern toolkits, we do not lose
the ability to build with older ones.

For this, `chroot` from the host system can be used, e.g. to improve the
interactive usability for a population of Debian(-compatible) containers
(and to use its networking, while the operating environment in containers
may be not yet configured or still struggling to access the Internet):
------
:; for ALTROOT in /srv/libvirt/rootfs/*/rootfs/ ; do \
    echo "=== $ALTROOT :" ; \
    chroot "$ALTROOT" apt-get install \
        sudo bash vim mc p7zip p7zip-full pigz pbzip2 git \
   ; done
------

Similarly for `yum`-managed systems (CentOS and relatives), though specific
package names can differ, and additional package repositories may need to
be enabled first (see link:config-prereqs.txt[config-prereqs.txt] for more
details such as recommended package names).

Note that technically `(sudo) chroot ...` can also be used from the CI worker
account on the host system to build in the prepared filesystems without the
overhead of running containers as complete operating environments with any
standard services and several copies of Jenkins `agent.jar` in them.

Also note that externally-driven set-up of some packages, including the
`ca-certificates` and the JDK/JRE, require that the `/proc` filesystem
is usable in the chroot environment. This can be achieved with e.g.:
------
:; for ALTROOT in /srv/libvirt/rootfs/*/rootfs/ ; do \
    for D in proc ; do \
      echo "=== $ALTROOT/$D :" ; \
      mkdir -p "$ALTROOT/$D" ; \
      mount -o bind,rw "/$D" "$ALTROOT/$D" ; \
    done ; \
   done
------

TODO: Test and document a working NAT and firewall setup for this, to allow
SSH access to the containers via dedicated TCP ports exposed on the host.

Arch Linux containers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Arch Linux containers prepared by procedure above include only a minimal
footprint, and if you missed the `-P pkg,list` argument, they can lack
even an SSH server. Suggestions below assume this path to container:
------
:; ALTROOT=/srv/libvirt/rootfs/jenkins-archlinux-amd64/rootfs/
------

Let `pacman` know current package database:
------
:; grep 8.8.8.8 $ALTROOT/etc/resolv.conf || (echo 'nameserver 8.8.8.8' > $ALTROOT/etc/resolv.conf)
:; chroot $ALTROOT pacman -Syu
:; chroot $ALTROOT pacman -S openssh sudo
:; chroot $ALTROOT systemctl enable sshd
:; chroot $ALTROOT systemctl start sshd
------

This may require that you perform bind-mounts above, as well as "passthrough"
the `/var/cache/pacman/pkg` from host to guest environment (in `virsh edit`,
and bind-mount for `chroot` like for `/proc` et al above).

It is possible that `virsh console` would serve you better than `chroot`.
Note you may have to first `chroot` to set the `root` password anyhow.


Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Q: Container won't start, its `virsh console` says something like:
+
------
Failed to create symlink /sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls: Operation not permitted
------
A: According to https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1770763
   (skip to the end for summary) this can happen when a newer Linux
   host system with `cgroupsv2` capabilities runs an older guest distro
   which only knows about `cgroupsv1`, such as when hosting a CentOS 7
   container on a Debian 11 server.
** One workaround is to ensure that the guest `systemd` does not try to
   "join" host facilities, by setting an explicit empty list for that:
+
------
:; echo 'JoinControllers=' >> "$ALTROOT/etc/systemd/system.conf"
------
** Another approach is to upgrade `systemd` related packages in the guest
   container. This may require additional "backport" repositories or
   similar means, possibly maintained not by distribution itself but by
   other community members, and arguably would logically compromise the
   idea of non-regression builds in the old environment "as is".

* Q: Server was set up with ZFS as recommended, and lots of I/O hit the
  disk even when application writes are negligible
+
A: This was seen on some servers and generally derives from data layout
   and how ZFS maintains the tree structure of blocks. A small application
   write (such as a new log line) means a new empty data block allocation,
   an old block release, and bubble up through the whole metadata tree to
   complete the transaction (grouped as TXG to flush to disk).
+
** One solution is to use discardable build workspaces in RAM-backed
   storage like `/dev/shm` (`tmpfs`) on Linux, or `/tmp` (`swap`) on
   illumos hosting systems, and only use persistent storage for the home
   directory with `.ccache` and `.gitcache-dynamatrix` directories.
** Another solution is to reduce the frequency of TXG sync from modern
   default of 5 sec to conservative 30-60 sec. Check how to set the
   `zfs_txg_timeout` on your platform.


Connecting Jenkins to the containers
------------------------------------

To properly cooperate with the
https://github.com/networkupstools/jenkins-dynamatrix[jenkins-dynamatrix]
project driving regular NUT CI builds, each build environment should be
exposed as an individual agent with labels describing its capabilities.

Agent Labels
~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the `jenkins-dynamatrix`, agent labels are used to calculate a large
"slow build" matrix to cover numerous scenarios for what can be tested
with the current population of the CI farm, across operating systems,
`make`, shell and compiler implementations and versions, and C/C++ language
revisions, to name a few common "axes" involved.

Labels for QEMU
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Emulated-CPU container builds are CPU-intensive, so for them we define as
few capabilities as possible: here CI is more interested in checking how
binaries behave on those CPUs, *not* in checking the quality of recipes
(distcheck, Make implementations, etc.), shell scripts or documentation,
which is more efficient to test on native platforms.

Still, we are interested in results from different compiler suites, so
specify at least one version of each.

NOTE: Currently the NUT `Jenkinsfile-dynamatrix` only looks at various
`COMPILER` variants for `qemu-nut-builder` use-cases, disregarding the
versions and just using one that the environment defaults to.

The reduced set of labels for QEMU workers looks like:

------
qemu-nut-builder qemu-nut-builder:alldrv
NUT_BUILD_CAPS=drivers:all NUT_BUILD_CAPS=cppunit
OS_FAMILY=linux OS_DISTRO=debian11 GCCVER=10 CLANGVER=11
COMPILER=GCC COMPILER=CLANG
ARCH64=ppc64le ARCH_BITS=64
------

Labels for native builds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For contrast, a "real" build agent's set of labels, depending on
presence or known lack of some capabilities, looks something like this:
------
doc-builder nut-builder nut-builder:alldrv
NUT_BUILD_CAPS=docs:man NUT_BUILD_CAPS=docs:all
NUT_BUILD_CAPS=drivers:all NUT_BUILD_CAPS=cppunit=no
OS_FAMILY=bsd OS_DISTRO=freebsd12 GCCVER=10 CLANGVER=10
COMPILER=GCC COMPILER=CLANG
ARCH64=amd64 ARCH_BITS=64
SHELL_PROGS=sh SHELL_PROGS=dash SHELL_PROGS=zsh SHELL_PROGS=bash
SHELL_PROGS=csh SHELL_PROGS=tcsh SHELL_PROGS=busybox
MAKE=make MAKE=gmake
PYTHON=python2.7 PYTHON=python3.8
------

Generic agent attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Name: e.g. `ci-debian-altroot--jenkins-debian10-arm64` (note the
  pattern for "Conflicts With" detailed below)

* Remote root directory: preferably unique per agent, to avoid surprises;
  e.g.: `/home/abuild/jenkins-nut-altroots/jenkins-debian10-armel`
** Note it may help that the system home directory itself is shared between
   co-located containers, so that the `.ccache` or `.gitcache-dynamatrix`
   are available to all builders with identical contents
** If RAM permits, the Jenkins Agent working directory may be placed in
   a temporary filesystem not backed by disk (e.g. `/dev/shm` on modern
   Linux distributions); roughly estimate 300Mb per executor for NUT builds.

* Usage: "Only build jobs with label expressions matching this node"

* Node properties / Environment variables:

** `PATH+LOCAL` => `/usr/lib/ccache`

Where to run agent.jar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on circumstances of the container, there are several options
available to the NUT CI farm:

* Java can run in the container, efficiently (native CPU, different distro)
  => the container may be exposed as a standalone host for direct SSH access
  (usually by NAT, exposing SSH on a dedicated port of the host; or by first
  connecting the Jenkins controller with the host as an SSH Build Agent, and
  then calling SSH to the container as a prefix for running the agent; or
  by using Jenkins Swarm agents), so ultimately the build `agent.jar` JVM
  would run in the container.
  Filesystem for the `abuild` account may be or not be shared with the host.

* Java can not run in the container (crashes on emulated CPU, or is too old
  in the agent container's distro -- currently Jenkins requires JRE 8+, but
  eventually will require 11+) => the agent would run on the host, and then
  the host would `ssh` or `chroot` (networking not required, but bind-mount
  of `/home/abuild` and maybe other paths from host would be needed) called
  for executing `sh` steps in the container environment. Either way, home
  directory of the `abuild` account is maintained on the host and shared with
  the guest environment, user and group IDs should match.

* Java is inefficient in the container (operations like un-stashing the source
  succeed but take minutes instead of seconds) => either of the above

Using Jenkins SSH Build Agents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a typical use-case for tightly integrated build farms under common
management, where the Jenkins controller can log by SSH into systems which
act as its build agents. It injects and launches the `agent.jar` to execute
child processes for the builds, and maintains a tunnel to communicate.

Methods below involving SSH assume that you have configured a password-less
key authentication from the host machine to the `abuild` account in each
guest build environment container.
This can be an `ssh-keygen` result posted into `authorized_keys`, or a
trusted key passed by a chain of ssh agents from a Jenkins Credential
for connection to the container-hoster into the container.
The private SSH key involved may be secured by a pass-phrase, as long as
your Jenkins Credential storage knows it too.
Note that for the approaches explored below, the containers are not
directly exposed for log-in from any external network.

* For passing the agent through an SSH connection from host to container,
  so that the `agent.jar` runs inside the container environment, configure:

** Launch method: "Agents via SSH"

** Host, Credentials, Port: as suitable for accessing the container-hoster
+
NOTE: The container-hoster should have accessed the guest container from
      the account used for intermediate access, e.g. `abuild`, so that its
      `.ssh/known_hosts` file would trust the SSH server on the container.

** Prefix Start Agent Command: content depends on the container name,
   but generally looks like the example below to report some info about
   the final target platform (and make sure `java` is usable) in the
   agent's log. Note that it ends with un-closed quote and a space char:
+
------
ssh jenkins-debian10-amd64 '( java -version & uname -a ; getconf LONG_BIT; getconf WORD_BIT; wait ) && 
------

** Suffix Start Agent Command: a single quote to close the text opened above:
------
'
------


* The other option is to run the `agent.jar` on the host, for all the
  network and filesystem magic the agent does, and only execute shell
  steps in the container. The solution relies on overridden `sh` step
  implementation in the `jenkins-dynamatrix` shared library that uses a
  magic `CI_WRAP_SH` environment variable to execute a pipe into the
  container. Such pipes can be `ssh` or `chroot` with appropriate host
  setup described above.
+
NOTE: In case of ssh piping, remember that the container's
      `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` should `AcceptEnv *` and the SSH
      server should be restarted after such configuration change.

** Launch method: "Agents via SSH"

** Host, Credentials, Port: as suitable for accessing the container-hoster

** Prefix Start Agent Command: content depends on the container name,
   but generally looks like the example below to report some info about
   the final target platform (and make sure it is accessible) in the
   agent's log. Note that it ends with a space char, and that the command
   here should not normally print anything into stderr/stdout (this tends
   to confuse the Jenkins Remoting protocol):
+
------
echo PING > /dev/tcp/jenkins-debian11-ppc64el/22 && 
------

** Suffix Start Agent Command: empty

* Node properties / Environment variables:

** `CI_WRAP_SH` =>
+
------
ssh -o SendEnv='*' "jenkins-debian11-ppc64el" /bin/sh -xe
------

Using Jenkins Swarm Agents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This approach allows remote systems to participate in the NUT CI farm by
dialing in and so defining an agent. A single contributing system may be
running a number of containers or virtual machines set up following the
instructions above, and each of those would be a separate build agent.

Such systems should be "dedicated" to contribution in the sense that
they should be up and connected for days, and sometimes tasks would land.

Configuration files maintained on the Swarm Agent system dictate which
labels or how many executors it would expose, etc. Credentials to access
the NUT CI farm Jenkins controller to register as an agent should be
arranged with the farm maintainers, and currently involve a GitHub account
with Jenkins role assignment for such access, and a token for authentication.

The https://github.com/networkupstools/jenkins-swarm-nutci[jenkins-swarm-nutci]
repository contains example code from such setup with a back-up server
experiment for the NUT CI farm, including auto-start method scripts for
Linux systemd and upstart, illumos SMF, and OpenBSD rcctl.

Sequentializing the stress
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running one agent at a time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Another aspect of farm management is that emulation is a slow and intensive
operation, so we can not run all agents and execute builds at the same time.

The current solution relies on
https://github.com/jimklimov/conflict-aware-ondemand-retention-strategy-plugin
to allow co-located build agents to "conflict" with each other -- when one
picks up a job from the queue, it blocks neighbors from starting; when it
is done, another may start.

Containers can be configured with "Availability => On demand", with shorter
cycle to switch over faster (the core code sleeps a minute between attempts):

* In demand delay: `0`;

* Idle delay: `0` (Jenkins may change it to `1`);

* Conflicts with: `^ci-debian-altroot--.*$` assuming that is the pattern
  for agent definitions in Jenkins -- not necessarily linked to hostnames.

Also, the "executors" count should be reduced to the amount of compilers
in that system (usually 2) and so avoid extra stress of scheduling too many
emulated-CPU builds at once.

Sequentializing the git cache access
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As part of the `jenkins-dynamatrix` optional optimizations, the NUT CI
recipe invoked via `Jenkinsfile-dynamatrix` maintains persistent git
reference repositories that can be used to cache NUT codebase (including
the tested commits) and so considerably speed up workspace preparation
when running numerous build scenarios on the same agent.

Such `.gitcache-dynamatrix` cache directories are located in the build
workspace location (unique for each agent), but on a system with numerous
containers these names can be symlinks pointing to a shared location.

To avoid collisions with several executors updating the same cache with
new commits, critical access windows are sequentialized with the use of
https://github.com/jenkinsci/lockable-resources-plugin[Lockable Resources
plugin]. On the `jenkins-dynamatrix` side this is facilitated by labels:
------
DYNAMATRIX_UNSTASH_PREFERENCE=scm-ws:nut-ci-src
DYNAMATRIX_REFREPO_WORKSPACE_LOCKNAME=gitcache-dynamatrix:SHARED_HYPERVISOR_NAME
------

* The `DYNAMATRIX_UNSTASH_PREFERENCE` tells the `jenkins-dynamatrix` library
  code which checkout/unstash strategy to use on a particular build agent
  (following values defined in the library; `scm-ws` means SCM caching
  under the agent workspace location, `nut-ci-src` names the cache for
  this project);
* The `DYNAMATRIX_REFREPO_WORKSPACE_LOCKNAME` specifies a semi-unique
  string: it should be same for all co-located agents which use the same
  shared cache location, e.g. guests on the same hypervisor; and it should
  be different for unrelated cache locations, e.g. different hypervisors
  and stand-alone machines.

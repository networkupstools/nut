Creating new client
===================

NUT provides bindings for several common languages that are
presented below. All these are released under the same license as
NUT (the GNU General Public License).

If none of these suits you for technical or legal reasons, you can
implement one easily using the <<net-protocol,Network protocol information>>.

The latter approach has been used to create the Python 'PyNUT' module, the
Nagios 'check_ups' plugin (and probably others), which can serve as a
reference.

C / C++
-------

Client access library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`libupsclient` and `libnutclient` libraries can be linked into other programs
to give access to upsd and UPS status information.
Both static and shared versions are provided.

These library files and associated header files are not installed by
default.  You must `./configure --with-dev` to enable building and
installing these files. The libraries can then be built and installed
with `make` and `make install` as usual. This must be done before
building other (non-NUT) programs which depend on them.

Low-level library: libupsclient
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`libupsclient` provides a low-level interface to directly dialog with upsd.
It is a wrapper around the NUT network protocol.

For more information, refer to the linkman:upsclient[3],
manual page and the various link:../man/index.html#devclient[upscli_*(3)]
functions documentation referenced in the same file.

Clients like upsc are provided as examples of how to retrieve data using the
upsclient functions.
link:http://www.networkupstools.org/projects.html[Other programs] not included
in this package may also use this library, such as wmnut.

High level library: libnutclient
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`libnutclient` provides a high-level interface representing devices, variables
and commands with an object-oriented API in C++ and C.

For more information, refer to the linkman:libnutclient[3] manual page.

  #include <iostream>
  #include <unistd.h>
  #include <stdlib.h>

  #include <nutclient.h>

  using namespace nut;
  using namespace std;

  // argv[1] is the mandatory NUT device name (@localhost), used to list variables from
  // argv[2] is an optional command. When provided, it will be executed and possibly with status tracking enabled
  int main(int argc, char **argv)
  {
    Client *client;
    try
    {
      // Connection
      client = new TcpClient("localhost", 3493);

      if (argc >= 2)
      {
        // Reading data from device
        Device mydev = client->getDevice(argv[1]);
        cout << "Description: " << mydev.getDescription() << endl;
        Variable var = mydev.getVariable("device.model");
        cout << "Model: " <<  var.getValue()[0] << endl;

        if (argc >= 3)
        {
          // Authenticate to NUT server
          const char *user = getenv("NUT_USER");
          const char *password = getenv("NUT_PASSWD");
          client->authenticate(user ? user : "", password ? password : "");

          // Enable command tracking, if available
          if (client->hasFeature(Client::TRACKING))
          {
            cout << "Server can do command tracking" << std::endl;
            client->setFeature(Client::TRACKING, true);
          }
          else
          {
            std::cout << "Server can't do command tracking" << std::endl;
          }

          // Perform an asynchronous command
          TrackingID id = mydev.executeCommand(argv[2]);
          TrackingResult result;
          do
          {
            sleep(1);
            result = client->getTrackingResult(id);
          }
          while (result == PENDING);

          // Display result of command
          const char *output = "<UNRECOGNIZED>";
          switch (result)
          {
            case SUCCESS: output = "SUCCESS"; break;
            case FAILURE: output = "FAILURE"; break;
            case UNKNOWN: output = "UNKNOWN"; break;
          }
          cout << "Command sent, result=" << output << endl;
        }
      }
    }
    catch (NutException &ex)
    {
      cerr << "Unexpected problem : " << ex.str() << endl;
    }
    delete client;
    return 0;
  }


Configuration helpers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NUT provides helper scripts to ease the configuration step of your program, by
detecting the right compilation and link flags.

For more information, refer to a
<<lib-info,Appendix B: NUT libraries complementary information>>.

Python
------

The PyNUT module, contributed by David Goncalves, can be used for connecting a
Python script to `upsd`. Note that this code (and the accompanying NUT-Monitor
application) is licensed under the GPL v3.

The `PyNUTClient` class abstracts the connection to the server. In order to
list the status variables for `ups1` on the local `upsd`, the following
commands could be used:

  $ cd scripts/python/module
  $ python
  ...
  >>> import PyNUT
  >>> from pprint import pprint
  >>> client = PyNUT.PyNUTClient()
  >>> vars = client.GetUPSVars('ups1')
  >>> pprint(vars)
  {'battery.charge': '90',
   'battery.charge.low': '30',
   'battery.runtime': '3690',
   'battery.voltage': '230.0',
  ...

Further examples are given in the `test_nutclient.py` file. To see the entire
API, you can run `pydoc` from the `module` directory.

If you wish to make the module available to everyone on the system, you will
probably want to install it in the `site-packages` directory for your Python
interpreter. (This is usually one of the last items in `sys.path`.)

Perl
----

The old Perl bindings from CPAN have recently been updated and merged into the
NUT source code. These operate in a similar fashion to the Python bindings,
with the addition of access to single variables, and additional interpretation
of the results. The Perl class instance encapsulates a single UPS, where the
Python class instance represents a connection to the server (which may service
multiple UPS units).

 use UPS::Nut;

 $ups = new UPS::Nut( NAME => "myups",
                      HOST => "somemachine.somewhere.com",
                      PORT => "3493",
                      USERNAME => "upsuser",
                      PASSWORD => "upspasswd",
                      TIMEOUT => 30,
                      DEBUG => 1,
                      DEBUGOUT => "/some/file/somewhere",
                    );
 if ($ups->Status() =~ /OB/) {
    print "Oh, no!  Power failure!\n";
 }

 tie %other_ups, 'UPS::Nut',
     NAME => "myups",
     HOST => "somemachine.somewhere.com",
     ... # same options as new();
 ;

 print $other_ups{MFR}, " ", $other_ups{MODEL}, "\n";

Java

The NUT Java support has been externalized.

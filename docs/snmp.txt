This document presents interactions between SNMP and Network UPS Tools.

There are two part in NUT for SNMP support:

1) the agent or server side

An SNMP agent provides information for its hardware.
In general, agents are embedded in SNMP card.

This part has to be implemented as a Net-SNMP sub agent, acting
as a NUT middleware (upsd level). Such software make a bridge
between NUT data and SNMP, thus allowing to monitor, through
SNMP, standard point to point UPSs (serial and USB).

This is part of the "UPS Sub-Agent" project with Net-SNMP team.


2) the client side

	* Introduction

An SNMP client communicates with an agent to acquire data.

This part, which has to be a NUT driver, is implemented by snmp-ups.
snmp-ups acts as a bridge from SNMP to NUT, thus allowing to monitor
in NUT any SNMP Agent (embedded or on a host).

The new snmp-ups driver now support multiple MIBS (SNMP structures
declaration). For more information on snmp-ups, have a look at its
manpage (man 8 snmp-ups).

This project is the result of years of work by many individuals and companies.

Many people have written or tweaked the software; the drivers, clients, server
and documentation have all received valuable attention from numerous sources.

Many of them are listed within the source code, AUTHORS file, release notes, and
mailing list archives, but some prefer to be anonymous.
This software would not be possible without their help.

[[Eaton]]
Our main supporter: Eaton
-------------------------

Through the acquisition of MGE Office Protection Systems (a carve out of
the MGE UPS SYSTEMS small systems, up to 10 KVA), Eaton has been supporting
NUT, and more generally the Free/Libre Opensource Software Community
since around 2002.

This support includes the following actions:

- providing extensive technical documents (Eaton protocols library),
- providing units to developers of NUT and related projects,
- hosting the networkupstools.org webserver (from 2005 to August 2012),
- providing artwork,
- promoting NUT in general.

Supporting manufacturers
------------------------

UPS manufacturers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- link:http://powerquality.eaton.com[Eaton], our main supporter, as presented in
the <<Eaton,above section>>.

- link:http://www.gamatronic.com[Gamatronic], through Nadav Moskovitch, has
revived the 'sec' driver (as gamatronic), and expanded a bit genericups for its
UPSs with alarm interface.

- link:http://www.microdowell.com[Microdowell], through Elio Corbolante, has
created the 'microdowell' driver to support the Enterprise Nxx/Bxx serial devices.
They also proposes NUT as an alternative to its software for
link:http://www.microdowell.com/fra/download.html[Linux / Unix].

- link:http://pcmups.com.tw[Powercom], through Alexey Morozov, has provided
link:ups-protocols.html[extensive information] on its USB/HID devices, along
with development units.

- link:http://www.riello-ups.com[Riello UPS], through Massimo Zampieri, has
provided link:ups-protocols.html[all protocols information]. Elio Parisi has
also created riello_ser and riello_usb to support these protocols.

- link:http://www.tripplite.com[Tripp Lite], through Eric Cobb, has provided
test results from connecting their HID-compliant UPS hardware to NUT. Some of
this information has been incorporated into the NUT hardware compatibility
list, and the rest of the information is available via the
link:http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.monitoring.nut.user/8173[list
archives].

Appliances manufacturers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- link:http://www.opengear.com[OpenGear] has worked with NUT's leader to
successfully develop and integrate PDU support. Opengear, through Scott Burns,
and Robert Waldie, has submitted several patches.

Other contributors
------------------

- Pavel Korensky's original apcd provided the inspiration for pursuing APC's
smart protocol in 1996
- Eric Lawson provided scans of the OneAC protocol
- John Marley used OCR software to transform the SEC protocol scans into a HTML
document
- Chris McKinnon scanned and converted the Fortress protocol documentation
- Tank provided documentation on the Belkin/Delta protocol
- Potrans provided a Fenton PowerPal 600 (P series) for development of the
safenet driver.

Older entries (before 2005)
---------------------------

- MGE UPS SYSTEMS was the previous NUT sponsor. They provided protocols
information, many units for development of NUT-related projects.
Several drivers such as mge-utalk, mge-shut, snmp-ups, hidups, and usbhid-ups
are the result of this collaboration, in addition to the WMNut, MGE HID Parser
the libhid projects, ... through Arnaud.
All the MGE supporters have now gone with Eaton (through MGE Office
Protection Systems), which is the new NUT sponsor.

- Fenton Technologies contributed a PowerPal 660 to the project.  Their open 
stance and quick responses to technical inquiries were appreciated for 
making the development of the fentonups driver possible.
Fenton has since been acquired by link:http://www.metapo.com[Metapo]. 

- Bo Kersey of link:http://www.vircio.com[VirCIO] provided a Best Power Fortress
750 to facilitate the bestups driver.  

- Invensys Energy Systems provided the SOLA/Best "Phoenixtec" protocol
document. SOLA has since been acquired by Eaton.

- PowerKinetics technical support provided documentation on their MiniCOL
protocol, which is archived in the NUT protocol library.
PowerKinetics was acquired by the link:http://www.jst.cc[JST Group] in June 2003.

- link:http://www.cyberpowersystems.com[Cyber Power Systems] contributed a
700AVR model for testing and development of the cyberpower driver.

- link:http://www.liebert.com[Liebert Corporation] supplied serial test boxes
and a UPStation GXT2 with the Web/SNMP card for development of the liebert
driver and expansion of the existing snmp-ups driver.
Liebert has since been acquired by link:http://www.emerson.com[Emerson].

NOTE: If a company or individual isn't listed here, then we probably don't have
enough information about the situation. Developers are requested to report vendor
contributions to the NUT team so this list may reflect their help.
If we have left you out, send us some mail.

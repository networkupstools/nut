Mailing lists administration
============================

NUT provides various
link:https://alioth.debian.org/mail/?group_id=30602[mailing list], to support
users and developers. These can administered at the following addresses:

- link:http://lists.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/mailman/admin/nut-upsuser[Nut-upsuser]
- link:http://lists.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/mailman/admin/nut-upsdev[Nut-upsdev]
- nut-tracker
- nut-packaging

The password is the same for all administrators, and is provided to any new
NUT admin.

Best moderation practices
-------------------------

These are the general rules that apply to mailing list moderation:

- non subscribed:
  - ACCEPT: complete entry submission (ie no need for further mail)
  - ACCEPT: foreign reply to cross mailing list post (ex: reply from FreeIPMI
    Al Chu to a mail from Arnaud on upsdev...)
  - ACCEPT: people that are already members, with another address.

- spams: always DISCARD, not REJECT, and apply a general ban to this address.

- big messages:
  - source code commits: forward the header, which mentions the changes, but
    not the actual changes details.
  - others (users feedback): ask for attachment compression, or using a link
    to store the file(s).

- other (ie report or request requiring more than 1 mail): REJECT with a
  message explaining the reason. The following can serve as a base:

	Dear XXX,
	Your message to the nut-upsXXX mailing was rejected because you must
	suscribe to the mailing list. This is just to eradicate spam noise from
	the mailing list.

	Use the following link to subscribe to this mailing list:
	https://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/nut-upsXXX

	where 'XXX' can be replaced by 'user', 'dev' or 'packaging'.

Release process
===============

New process:
- we will only work on the trunk for the day to day bugfixing and
  standard modifications (what was mostly happening in Testing
  currently),
- the trunk will be used to generate the testing releases (only using
  the tags, after a small freeze period),
- bigger changes, invasive modifications and cutting edge developments
  will have to be addressed in separate branches, until stabilization.
  When things are ok and validated to enter the trunk, merging these
  branches into the trunk can happen.

I insist on the *validation* to enter the trunk, since some changes
might have to wait for major releases, to match our current release
process.

MAINTAINER SANDBOX (to be completed and pushed)

* be sure to proceed with the below steps on a system provisioned with all
  possible build prerequisites for NUT, especially regarding documentation
  and nut-website building and checking, and with maintainer GPG keys in
  the chain

* clean up "in-development" bits from files (which we would revert after
  release), e.g.:
** TODO etc. referring planned future in the `NEWS.adoc` and `UPDATING.adoc`
   files - except for the upcoming release
** DO NOT yet remove "PLANNED:" from the new release section title
** comment away the top-most (auto-resolved) NUT version and build date
   in `docs/docinfo.xml.in` -- DO NOT add (or at least commit) an entry
   for the actual fixed release version and date just yet
** NOTE: The `docs/docinfo.xml.sh` script can help update the list for
   existing git tags, if some were skipped before. This can be used to
   cheat a bit about adding the new entry (with a draft tag).
** commit this change (to add a revert-commit after the release tag), e.g.:
+
----
:; git commit -sm 'NEWS.adoc, UPGRADING.adoc, docs/docinfo.xml.in: finalize text before NUT v2.8.0 release'
----

* revise the contents of `NEWS.adoc` and `UPDATING.adoc` files; verify that
  any recent changes to drivers (including `main.c` and other major impact
  from common code) and sub-drivers (`*-hid.c` for `usbhid-ups`, `*-mib.c`
  for `snmp-ups`, `nutdrv_qx_*` etc.) have been reflected in bumps to their
  `DRIVER_VERSION` or equivalent macros
** ideally maintained during development, as features are getting merged for
   community testing and future development baseline in the master branch
** this is the good time to remove the `PLANNED` status from the upcoming
   release info section title and commit it separately, e.g.:
+
----
:; git commit -sm 'NEWS.adoc: remove "PLANNED" from section title before NUT v2.8.0 release'
----
* NOTE that the `ChangeLog` file is currently not tracked in SCM
* update this document: `docs/maintainer-guide.txt` as it inevitably requires
* commit these finishing touches

* add an entry in `docs/docinfo.xml.in` for the actual fixed release version
   and date, focusing on what was changed since last release documentation-wise;
+
----
:; git commit -sm 'docs/docinfo.xml.in: add docs increment summary for NUT v2.8.0 release'
----

* bump the release identification (consider committing as one commit later on):
** see `docs/nut-versioning.adoc` for details about NUT SEMVER spec and practice
** update the fallback `NUT_DEFAULT_VERSION` in `tools/gitlog2version.sh` to
   <exact incremented version> (ex: `2.8.0`), and provide the `VERSION_FORCED`
   and `VERSION_FORCED_SEMVER` files (to same effect but more explicitly and
   visibly) in the local workspace to be added to the `dist` archive tarball
   file (DO NOT add them to git to avoid confusion later, or revert any such
   addition after the release -- still has a chance to confuse e.g. branches
   made from release tag later):
+
----
# Generally may be the nuanced NUT SEMVER; is a triplet for releases
:; echo 'NUT_VERSION_FORCED="2.8.3"' > VERSION_FORCED

# Should always be a triplet
:; echo 'NUT_VERSION_FORCED_SEMVER="2.8.3"' > VERSION_FORCED_SEMVER
----
*** Note that since NUT v2.8.3 this script dictates the version propagated by
    the `configure` script, so direct changes of `AC_INIT` there are no longer
    needed
** revise `.github/workflows/PyNUTClient.yml` for fallback `TAG_NAME` naming
** revise `appveyor.yml` for branch naming
** revise `scripts/Windows/build-mingw-nut.sh` for fallback value of `VER_OPT`
** commit with a relevant release message, e.g.:
+
----
:; git commit -sm 'Update versions for release of NUT v2.8.0'
----

* last-minute update against possible master-branch changes (and be sure to
  apply the release-version changes described above to your local copy of
  the `master` branch, even if originally staged in another):
+
----
:; git fetch --all && git rebase upstream/master -i --autosquash
----
* run the last-minute build to be sure the release is sane (no typos in any
  recently changed document files, etc.) with `./ci_build.sh` or full ritual:
+
----
:; rm -f Makefile configure
:; ./autogen.sh && \
   ./configure --with-all --with-dev --with-doc --enable-spellcheck \
      --enable-warnings --enable-Werror --enable-maintainer-mode && \
   make -j 8 all && \
   make -j 8 spellcheck && \
   make -j 8 distcheck
----
* create an annotated GPG-signed tag v<incremented version> (ex: `v2.8.0`):
+
----
:; git tag -asm 'Release NUT v2.8.0' v2.8.0
----
** in case of second thoughts, `git tag -d v2.8.0` and retry later
** try to avoid adding signed tags later (ex. v2.8.0-signed) to avoid the
   mess in GitHub release URLs (or do amend that post-factum), for more
   details see e.g. https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1971
* don't forget to push not only the code, but also the tag:
+
----
:; git push upstream && git push --tags upstream
----

* `make dist-files` (especially if you did not `make distcheck` above,
  or had some changes since then) to store the source tarball, checksum
  and signature files

* post-release update of the "in-development" codebase:
** update the fallback `NUT_DEFAULT_VERSION` in `tools/gitlog2version.sh` to
   <incremented version>.1 (ex: `2.8.0.1`); remove the `VERSION_FORCED`
   and `VERSION_FORCED_SEMVER` files
** `git revert` the commit which cleaned up "in-development" bits above
** Possibly resolve relevant merge conflicts for the changed context,
   e.g. the changed "PLANNED" status of the now-issued release info

* push commits and tag

* Update `nut-website`:
** rendering should auto-update by NUT CI farm based on source changes,
   but in case of urgency -- can be expedited with a prepared workstation
   (see README of that project) or from the NUT CI farm agent directly
** add an entry to `news.txt`
** update `nut` and `ddl` submodules in nut-website/ to refer to latest info
   as of current release (this should update the website's version as well).
   NOTE: for `nut` submodule be sure to refer to the tagged commit, not to
   the subsequent "in-development" codebase.
** in `source` submodule add a copy of tarball, checksum and hash files for
   download: `make dist{,-hash,-sig}` (or since NUT v2.8.3, `make dist-files`)
*** for a `new-X.Y.Z.txt` file use the `NEWS.adoc` with a stripped title
    (see existing files)
** `git tag` the website release
** generate and publish a "historic" sub-site snapshot (currently manually,
   check comments in nut-website's `ci_build.sh` script and/or its README file)
** update `nut` submodule to current commit ("in-development" codebase), and
   the `historic/index.txt` to refer to the snapshot for reference (users of
   specific-version packages)
** generate and publish the usual website revision (by CI or manually)
** Note that it may be needed to manually copy the new tarball-related files,
   `new-X.Y.Z.txt`, change log, and maintainer keys (if updated), into the
   rendered website repository, even if using the CI scripted publication.

* check that the website renders properly (a few minutes after publication)
** re-check the tarball signature according to current `security.txt` document
   on an empty VM/container/chroot/user-home setup, to make sure that the GPG
   instructions fit the reality (needed maintainer keys are published, etc.)

* draft and publish a GitHub release based on the signed tag
** attach the same copy of tarball, checksum and hash files as for nut-website

* Make sure that the PyNUT module for the tagged release got published to
  the main PyPI repository, as a build associated with the NUT release
  version. This *should* be ensured by the GitHub actions, but the curent
  workflow definition uses both `paths` and `branches`/`tags` triggers and
  this may cause a release to be skipped if the PyNUT sources did not change.
  The `scripts/python/module/Makefile.am` recipes automate the needed actions
  to happen from a prepared maintainer's operating environment.

* announce on mailing list, IRC, etc.

* update https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_UPS_Tools

* create a GitHub issue label for the new release, e.g. at
  https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/labels?q=impact :
----
impacts-release-2.8.0
Issues reported against NUT release 2.8.0 (maybe vanilla or with minor packaging tweaks)

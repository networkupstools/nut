NUT versioning
==============

Historic note
-------------

Historically, the Network UPS Tools project release and interim iterations
code base versions were identified by three or four numeric components,
roughly following the Semantic Versioning (SEMVER) traditions, later
codified as a formal standard at link:https://semver.org/[semver.org]:

* NUT uses the GNU autotools suite for recipe orchestration, and the version
  string is specified in the `configure.ac` file an `AC_INIT` macro, which
  further generates variables like `PACKAGE_VERSION`, `PACKAGE_URL` and others
  used (substituted) in the actual code base, often via `nut_version.h` file.
* NUT releases were identified by a `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` triplet, which
  was not strictly following the standard in that while the "major" part
  did reflect architectural/design changes, and "minor" part reflected some
  significant development milestones or API changes, the "patch" part did
  not correspond to post-release fixes but reflected iterative development,
  of which releases were the better-reviewed snapshots. Such a triplet was
  only spelled in `AC_INIT` for the commit tagged as that release.
* Until NUT v2.6.x, the odd values of the `MINOR` component meant development
  code trees, and even values meant the stable tree. This approach was
  skipped (or effectively abandoned, as over a decade passed) with the
  move to Git branches for development -- as numerous NUT v2.7.x based
  releases were produced, and development continued into NUT v2.8.x.
* NUT development versions were specified by the next commit after a
  release was published, spelling an `AC_INIT` macro argument like
  `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.1` to provide a fourth component -- which is
  logically "greater than" `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` for comparisons, so that
  the developed version can formally be installed over a preceding
  release (e.g. from custom testing packages).

This configuration with a single development version (`.1`) was not very
helpful for the faster pace of iterations, especially as the Git workflow
and pull requests were adopted as the way of iterating the NUT development.
This did not really help identify the build being tested by CI or reported
by a community member, nor quickly determine if one custom build is "newer"
than another (e.g. can be a recommended upgrade from the previously installed
snapshot to check if some bug was fixed).

Some experiments were done adding the `git describe` output to version
banners reported by programs. These provide the number of commits since
the most-recent known git tag, as well as the git hash of the NUT sources
involved. This made the builds better identifiable, but did not help
compare the feature branches and the main trunk of development: any code
committed after a release has its own count of commits since that tag,
this one number does not really suffice.

Current NUT SEMVER definition
-----------------------------

Since NUT v2.8.3, the definition which goes into `AC_INIT` and further into
the code was extended in a manner similar to what `git describe` produces,
but with added numbers after the common triplet of semantically versioned
numbers: `X.Y.Z(.T(.B(-C+H(+R))))` or `X.Y.Z(.T(.B(-R)))`

* Standard semver (used in releases):
+
NOTE: Historically NUT did not *diligently* follow the standard semver triplet,
primarily because a snapshot of trunk is tested and released, and work
moves on with the PATCH part (rarely MINOR one) incremented; no actual
patches are released to some sustaining track of an older release lineage.
There were large re-designs that got MAJOR up to 2, though.

  - `X`: MAJOR - incompatible API changes
  - `Y`: MINOR - major new features and/or API evolution
  - `Z`: PATCH - bug fixes (and new features like added drivers)
* Extended semver (for snapshots of trunk):
  - T: (optional) Commits on trunk since previous release tag
* Extended semver (for features branched off trunk):
  - B: (optional) Commits on branch since nearest ancestor which is on trunk

The optional suffix (only for commits which are not git tags themselves)
is provided by `git describe`:

* C: Commits on branch since previous release tag
* H: (Short) Git hash (prefixed by "g" character) of the described commit

The pre-release information (if provided/known) would either follow the
optional suffix detailed above, or it would be the suffix itself:

* R: If this commit has a non-release tag, it can be optionally reported
     so we know that a commit some '1234' iterations after release 'N' is
     also a release candidate for 'N+1'. Note that any dash in that tag value
     will be replaced by a plus, e.g. `2.8.2.2878.1-2879+g882dd4b00+v2.8.3+rc6`

The numeric part of NUT SEMVER definition mostly follows https://semver.org/
except that for development iterations the base version may have up to
five dot-separated numeric components (SEMVER triplet for base release,
and additional data described above). Unlike standard semver provisions
for "pre-release versions" (separated by a minus sign after the triplet),
which are "less than" that release for comparisons, the fourth and fifth
components (if present) are "greater than" that release and any preceding
development iterations made after it.

Helper script `tools/gitlog2version.sh` is used to determine the project
version from packager-provided override files (or equivalents provided by
`make dist` in a snapshot/release tarball), git metadata from the current
workspace, or built-in fallback defaults.

Occasionally there may be tagged pre-releases, which follow the standard
semver markup, like `v2.8.0-rc3` (in git), however they would be converted
to NUT SEMVER here (as a number of commits since previous release) by default.

Using gitlog2version.sh
-----------------------

The script can be controlled by environment variables, including some sourced
from configuration files. It identifies a number of data items, and reports
the one specified by `NUT_VERSION_QUERY` on `stdout`.

NOTE: It does not currently have a query to report "everything" in a manner
that can be processed by `eval` in calling shell scripts (or `Makefile` rule
implementations).

|`abs_top_builddir`	| Top build directory (defaults to `abs_top_srcdir`)
			| `/home/abuild/.builds/linux/nut`
|`NUT_VERSION_FORCED`	| Set `NUT_VERSION_DEFAULT` (extended NUT SEMVER,
			  may be just a triplet) to this value and enforce
			  `NUT_VERSION_PREFER_GIT=false`. Usually sourced
			  from `${abs_top_srcdir}/VERSION_FORCED` (if present)
			| `2.8.2.2379` `2.8.3-rc3`

|`NUT_VERSION_DEFAULT`	| Usually sourced from either
			  `${abs_top_builddir}/VERSION_DEFAULT` (if present)

			  in which case the script also defaults
			  `NUT_VERSION_PREFER_GIT=false` (unless it is already

			  If no value was provided, a hard-coded value is used
			  (updated as part of maintainers' release rituals).

|`NUT_VERSION_PREFER_GIT`	| If not provided by caller, or sourced files,
			  or defaulted with `NUT_VERSION_FORCED` or

Use in C code
-------------

common-nut_version.c
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The `NUT_VERSION_MACRO` is used in `common/common-nut_version.c` and further
  made known to all code base as a static string `UPS_VERSION` linked via
  `libcommon*.la` internal libraries.
* Method `describe_NUT_VERSION_once()` prepares the string which combines the
  `NUT_VERSION_MACRO` with comments that it is either a `release` or a
  `(development iteration after $NUT_VERSION_SEMVER_MACRO)`, based on
  the value of `NUT_VERSION_IS_RELEASE`.
+
It is used from a number of other methods, such as `print_banner_once()`,
  `nut_report_config_flags()`, and so ends up in version reports of programs
  via their `help()`/`usage()` methods.
* Methods `suggest_doc_links_CMD_SYS()` and `suggest_doc_links_CMD_USR()` help
  by preparing a uniform bit of text for driver and tool programs to report in
  their `help()`/`usage()` methods, to refer to their locally delivered manual
  page (if documentation was built) and an on-line copy under the
  `NUT_WEBSITE_BASE`.

Man pages
~~~~~~~~~

* Manual pages and other documentation consume the `PACKAGE_VERSION`,
  `PACKAGE_VERSION` and `NUT_WEBSITE_BASE` as `asciidoc` attributes
  when rendering HTML/PDF/man document formats.
* The `NUT_WEBSITE_BASE` is also substituted instead of literal
  `https://www.networkupstools.org/*` which follows a `home page:` prefix
  (so that the pages rendered for a release refer to the historic website).

systemd and SMF manifests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Service manifests include references to documentation for the tools they wrap,
including published pages under the `NUT_WEBSITE_BASE` for the development or
historic variants of the NUT website.

NUT-Monitor (Python UI) and PyNUTClient
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The `PACKAGE_VERSION` and `NUT_WEBSITE_BASE` are reported in the About dialog.
* Version information is propagated into PyPI packages for the `PyNUTClient`
  module.

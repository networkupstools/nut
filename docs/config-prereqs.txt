Prerequisites for building NUT on different OSes
================================================
endif::website[]

This chapter aims to list packages with the tools needed on a freshly minimally
deployed worker to build as many targets of NUT recipes as possible, mainly
the diverse driver and documentation types.

NUT codebase generally should not depend on particular operating system or
kernel technology and version, and with the operating systems listed below
one can benefit from use of containers (jails, zones) to build and test
against numerous OS distributions on one physical or virtual machine,
e.g. to cover non-regression with older tool kits while taking advantage
of new releases.

* For Linux systems, we have notes on link:ci-farm-lxc-setup.txt[Setting
  up the multi-arch Linux LXC container farm for NUT CI]

Some of the below are alternatives, e.g. compiler toolkits (gcc vs. clang)
or SSL implementations (OpenSSL vs Mozilla NSS) -- no problem installing
both, at a disk space cost.

NOTE: Some NUT branches may need additional or different software versions
that are not yet included into `master` branch dependencies, e.g. the DMF
(Dynamic Mapping Files) sub-project needs LUA 5.1.

More packages and/or system setup may be needed to actually run NUT with
all features enabled; chapters below concern just with building it.

General call to Test the ability to configure and build
-------------------------------------------------------

Check out from git, generate files and configure to tailor to your build
environment, and build some tests:

------
:; mkdir -p nut && cd nut && \
    git clone https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/ -b master .
:; ./autogen.sh && \
    ./configure --with-doc=all --with-all --with-cgi && \
    make all && make check && make spellcheck
------

You can toggle some `configure` options to check different dependency
variants, e.g. `--with-ssl=nss` vs. `--with-ssl=openssl`

For reproducible runs of various pre-sets of configuration during
development, take a look at `ci_build.sh` script and different `BUILD_TYPE`
(and other) environment variable settings that it supports. A minimal run
with it is just to call the script, e.g.:

------
:; mkdir -p nut && cd nut && \
   git clone https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/ -b fightwarn .
:; ./ci_build.sh
------

[NOTE]
======
To build older releases, such as "vanilla" NUT 2.7.4 and older,
you may need to address some nuances:

* Ensure that `python` in `PATH` points to a python-2.x implementation
  (`master` branch is fixed to work with python 2 and 3)

* Ensure that `bash` is your user and maybe system shell (or ensure the
  generated `configure` script gets interpreted by it)

* Generally you may have better results with GNU Make newer than 3.81
  than with other make implementations; however, builds are regularly
  tested by CI with Sun dmake and BSD make as well, so recipes should
  not expect GNU-only syntax and constructs to work

* Parallel builds should be okay in current development version and
  since NUT 2.8.0 (is a bug to log and fix, if not), but they may be
  failure-prone in 2.7.4 and earlier releases
======

For intensive rebuilds, `ccache` is recommended. Note that instructions
below detail how to provide its directory with symlinks as `/usr/lib/ccache`
which is not the default case in all OS distributions. Recent versions of
the NUT `ci_build.sh` script allow to override the location by using the
`CI_CCACHE_SYMLINKDIR` environment variable, which is cumbersome and only
recommended for build agents with immutable system areas, etc.


Build prerequisites to make NUT from scratch on various Operating Systems
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Debian 10/11
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Being a popular baseline among Linux distributions, Debian is an
important build target. Related common operating systems include
Ubuntu and customized distros for Raspberry Pi, Proxmox, as well
as many others.

The package list below should largely apply to those as well,
however note that some well-known package names tend to differ.
A few of those are noted below.

[NOTE]
======
While Debian distros I've seen (8 to 11) provide a "libusb-dev"
for libusb-0.1 headers, the binary library package name is specifically
versioned package by default of the current release (e.g. "libusb-0.1-4"),
while names of both the library and development packages for libusb-1.0
must be determined with:
------
:; apt-cache search 'libusb.*1\.0.*
------
yielding e.g. "libusb-1.0-0-dev" (string name was seen with different
actual package source versions on both Debian 8 "Jessie" and
Debian 11 "Buster").
======

Debian-like package installations commonly start with an update of
metadata about recently published package revisions:

------
:; apt-get update

# NOTE: Older Debian-like distributions may lack a "libtool-bin"
:; apt-get install \
    ccache time \
    git python perl curl \
    make autoconf automake libltdl-dev libtool-bin libtool \
    valgrind \
    cppcheck \
    pkg-config \
    gcc g++ clang

# NOTE: For python, you may eventually have to specify a variant like this
# (numbers depending on default or additional packages of your distro):
#   :; apt-get install python2 python2.7 python-is-python2
# and/or:
#   :; apt-get install python3 python3.9
# You can find a list of what is (pre-)installed with:
#   :; dpkg -l | grep -Ei 'perl|python'

# For spell-checking, highly recommended if you would propose pull requests:
:; apt-get install \
    aspell aspell-en

# For other doc types (man-page, PDF, HTML) generation - massive packages (TEX, X11):
:; apt-get install \
    asciidoc source-highlight python3-pygments dblatex

# For CGI graph generation - massive packages (X11):
:; apt-get install \
    libgd-dev

# NOTE: Some older Debian-like distributions, could ship "libcrypto-dev"
# and/or "openssl-dev" instead of "libssl-dev" by its modern name
:; apt-get install \
    libcppunit-dev \
    libssl-dev libnss3-dev \
    augeas-tools libaugeas-dev augeas-lenses \
    libusb-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev \
    libi2c-dev \
    libmodbus-dev \
    libsnmp-dev \
    libpowerman0-dev \
    libfreeipmi-dev libipmimonitoring-dev \
    libavahi-common-dev libavahi-core-dev libavahi-client-dev
# For libneon, see below

:; apt-get install \
    lua5.1-dev

:; apt-get install \
    bash dash ksh busybox
------

Alternatives that can depend on your system's other packaging choices:
------
:; apt-get install libneon27-dev
# ... or
:; apt-get install libneon27-gnutls-dev
------

Over time, Debian and Ubuntu had different packages and libraries providing
the actual methods for I2C; if your system lacks the `libi2c` (and so fails
to `./configure --with-all`), try adding the following packages:
------
:; apt-get install build-essential git-core libi2c-dev i2c-tools lm-sensors
------

For cross-builds (note that not everything supports multilib approach,
limiting standard package installations to one or another implementation;
in that case local containers each with one ARCH may be a better choice,
with `qemu-user-static` playing a role to "natively" run the other-ARCH
complete environments):
------
:; apt-get install \
    gcc-multilib g++-multilib \
    crossbuild-essential \
    gcc-10:armhf gcc-10-base:armhf \
    qemu-user-static
------

NOTE: For Jenkins agents, also need to `apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk-headless`.
You may have to ensure that `/proc` is mounted in the target chroot
(or do this from the running container).

CentOS 7
~~~~~~~~

CentOS is another popular baseline among Linux distributions, being a free
derivative of the RedHat Linux, upon which many other distros are based as
well. These systems typically use the RPM package manager, using directly
`rpm` command, or `yum` or `dnf` front-ends depending on their generation.

For CentOS 7 it seems that not all repositories are equally good; some of
the software below is only served by EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise
Linux), as detailed at:

* https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/epel/
* https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/whats-epel-and-how-do-i-use-it
* https://pkgs.org/download/epel-release

You may have to specify a mirror as the `baseurl` in a `/etc/yum.repos.d/...`
file (as the aged distributions become less served by mirrors), such as:

* https://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/
+
------
# e.g. for CentOS7 currently:
:; yum install https://download-ib01.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/Packages/e/epel-release-7-14.noarch.rpm

# And edit /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo to uncomment and set the baseurl=...
# lines, and comment away the mirrorlist= lines (if yum hiccups otherwise)
------

General developer system helpers mentioned in link:ci-farm-lxc-setup.txt[]:
------
:; yum update

:; yum install \
    sudo vim mc p7zip pigz pbzip2
------

NOTE: Below we request to install generic `python` per system defaults.
You may request specifically `python2` or `python3` (or both): current
NUT should be compatible with both (2.7+ at least).

NOTE: On CentOS, `libusb` means 0.1.x and `libusbx` means 1.x.x API version.

NOTE: On CentOS, it seems that development against libi2c/smbus is not
supported. Neither the suitable devel packages were found, nor i2c-based
drivers in distro packaging of NUT. Resolution and doc PRs are welcome.

------
:; yum install \
    ccache time \
    file systemd-devel \
    git python perl curl \
    make autoconf automake libtool-ltdl-devel libtool \
    valgrind \
    cppcheck \
    pkgconfig \
    gcc gcc-c++ clang

# NOTE: For python, you may eventually have to specify a variant like this
# (numbers depending on default or additional packages of your distro):
#   :; yum install python-2.7.5
# and/or:
#   :; yum install python3 python3-3.6.8
# You can find a list of what is (pre-)installed with:
#   :; rpm -qa | grep -Ei 'perl|python'

# For spell-checking, highly recommended if you would propose pull requests:
:; yum install \
    aspell aspell-en

# For other doc types (man-page, PDF, HTML) generation - massive packages (TEX, X11):
:; yum install \
    asciidoc source-highlight python-pygments dblatex

# For CGI graph generation - massive packages (X11):
:; yum install \
    gd-devel

# NOTE: "libusbx" is the CentOS way of naming "libusb-1.0"
# vs. the older "libusb" as the package with "libusb-0.1"
:; yum install \
    cppunit-devel \
    openssl-devel nss-devel \
    augeas augeas-devel \
    libusb-devel libusbx-devel \
    i2c-tools \
    libmodbus-devel \
    net-snmp-devel \
    powerman-devel \
    freeipmi-devel \
    avahi-devel \
    neon-devel
#?# is python-augeas needed? exists at least...
#?# no (lib)i2c-devel ...
#?# no (lib)ipmimonitoring-devel ... would "freeipmi-ipmidetectd" cut it at least for run-time?

# Some NUT code related to lua may be currently limited to lua-5.1
# or possibly 5.2; the former is default in CentOS 7 releases...
:; yum install \
    lua-devel

:; yum install \
    bash dash ksh
------

NOTE: `busybox` is not packaged for CentOS 7 release; a static binary can
be downloaded if needed. For more details, see
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/475584/cannot-install-busybox-on-centos

CentOS packaging for 64-bit systems delivers the directory for dispatching
compiler symlinks as `/usr/lib64/ccache`. You can set it up same way as for
other described environments by adding a symlink `/usr/lib/ccache`:
------
:; ln -s ../lib64/ccache/ "$ALTROOT"/usr/lib/
------

NOTE: For Jenkins agents, also need to `yum install java-11-openjdk-headless`.

Arch Linux
~~~~~~~~~~

Update the lower-level OS and package databases:
------
:; pacman -Syu
------

Install tools and prerequisites for NUT:
------
:; pacman -S --needed \
    base-devel \
    autoconf automake libtool libltdl \
    clang gcc \
    ccache \
    git \
    vim python perl \
    pkgconf \
    cppcheck valgrind

# For spell-checking, highly recommended if you would propose pull requests:
:; pacman -S --needed \
    aspell en-aspell

# For man-page doc types generation:
:; pacman -S --needed \
    asciidoc

# For other doc types (PDF, HTML) generation - massive packages (TEX, X11):
:; pacman -S --needed \
    source-highlight dblatex

# For CGI graph generation - massive packages (X11):
:; pacman -S --needed \
    gd

:; pacman -S --needed \
    cppunit \
    openssl nss \
    augeas \
    libusb \
    neon \
    net-snmp \
    freeipmi \
    avahi

:; pacman -S --needed \
    lua51

:; pacman -S --needed \
    bash dash busybox ksh93
------

Recommended for NUT CI farm integration (matching specific toolkit versions
in a build matrix), and note the unusual location of `/usr/lib/ccache/bin/`
for symlinks:
------
:; gcc --version
gcc (GCC) 12.2.0
...

# Note: this distro delivers "gcc" et al as file names
# so symlinks like this may erode after upgrades.
# TODO: Rename and then link?..
:; (cd /usr/bin \
    && for V in 12 12.2.0 ; do for T in gcc g++ cpp ; do \
        ln -fsr $T $T-$V ; \
    done; done)
:; (cd /usr/lib/ccache/bin/ \
    && for V in 12 12.2.0 ; do for T in gcc g++ ; do \
        ln -fsr /usr/bin/ccache $T-$V ; \
    done; done)


:; clang --version
clang version 14.0.6
...

:; (cd /usr/bin && ln -fs clang-14 clang++-14 && ln -fs clang-14 clang-cpp-14)
:; (cd /usr/lib/ccache/bin/ \
    && for V in 14 ; do for T in clang clang++ ; do \
        ln -fsr /usr/bin/ccache $T-$V ; \
    done; done)
------

Also for CI build agents, a Java environment (JDK11+ since summer 2022) is
required:
------
# Search for available Java versions:
:; pacman -Ss | egrep 'jre|jdk'

# Pick one:
:; pacman -S --needed \
    jre11-openjdk-headless
------

FreeBSD 12.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that `PATH` for builds on BSD should include `/usr/local/...`:

------
:; PATH=/usr/local/libexec/ccache:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:$PATH
:; export PATH
------

NOTE: You may want to reference `ccache` even before all that, as detailed
below.

------
:; pkg install \
    git python perl5 curl \
    gmake autoconf automake autotools libltdl libtool \
    valgrind \
    cppcheck \
    pkgconf \
    gcc clang

# NOTE: For python, you may eventually have to specify a variant like this
# (numbers depending on default or additional packages of your distro):
#   :; pkg install python2 python27
# and/or:
#   :; pkg install python3 python37
# You can find a list of what is (pre-)installed with:
#   :; pkg info | grep -Ei 'perl|python'

# For spell-checking, highly recommended if you would propose pull requests:
:; pkg install \
    aspell en-aspell

# For other doc types (man-page, PDF, HTML) generation - massive packages (TEX, X11):
:; pkg install \
    asciidoc source-highlight textproc/py-pygments dblatex

# For CGI graph generation - massive packages (X11):
:; pkg install \
    libgd

:; pkg install \
    cppunit \
    openssl nss \
    augeas \
    libmodbus \
    neon \
    net-snmp \
    powerman \
    freeipmi \
    avahi

:; pkg install \
    lua51

:; pkg install \
    bash dash busybox ksh93
------

Recommended:
------
:; pkg install ccache
:; ccache-update-links
------

For compatibility with common setups on other operating systems, can symlink
`/usr/local/libexec/ccache` as `/usr/lib/ccache` and possibly add dash-number
suffixed symlinks to compiler tools (e.g. `gcc-10` beside `gcc10` installed
by package).

NOTE: For Jenkins agents, also need to `pkg install openjdk11` (11 or 17
required since summer 2022) -- and do note its further OS configuration
suggestions for special filesystem mounts.

Due to BSD specific paths *when not using* an implementation of `pkg-config`
or `pkgconf` (so guessing of flags is left to administrator -- TBD in NUT
`m4` scripts), better use this routine to test the config/build:
----
:; ./configure --with-doc=all --with-all --with-cgi \
    --without-avahi --without-powerman --without-modbus \
    ### CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include" \
    ### LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/lib"
----

Note the lack of `pkg-config` also precludes `libcppunit` tests, although
they also tend to mis-compile/mis-link with GCC (while CLANG seems okay).

OpenBSD 6.5
~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that `PATH` for builds on BSD should include `/usr/local/...`:

------
:; PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH
:; export PATH
------

NOTE: You may want to reference `ccache` even before all that, as detailed
below.

OpenBSD delivers many versions of numerous packages, you should specify
your pick interactively or as part of package name (e.g. `autoconf-2.69p2`).

NOTE: For the purposes of builds with Jenkins CI agents, since summer 2022 it
requires JDK11 which was first delivered with OpenBSD 6.5. Earlier iterations
used OpenBSD 6.4 and version nuances in this document may still reflect that.

During builds, you may have to tell system dispatcher scripts which version
to use (which feels inconvenient, but on the up-side for CI -- this system
allows to test many versions of auto-tools in the same agent), e.g.:
------
:; export AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.69 AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.10
------

To use the `ci_build.sh` don't forget `bash` which is not part of OpenBSD
base installation. It is not required for "legacy" builds arranged by just
`autogen.sh` and `configure` scripts.

NOTE: The OpenBSD 6.5 `install65.iso` installation includes a set of packages
that seems to exceed whatever is available on network mirrors; for example,
the CD image included `clang` program while it is not available to `pkg_add`,
at least not via http://ftp.netbsd.hu/mirrors/openbsd/6.5/packages/amd64/
mirror. The `gcc` version on CD image differed notably from that in the
networked repository (4.2.x vs 4.9.x).
You may have to echo a working base URL (part before "6.5/..." into the
`/etc/installurl` file, since the old distribution is no longer served by
default site.

------
# Optionally, make the environment comfortable, e.g.:
:; pkg_add sudo bash mc wget rsync

:; pkg_add \
    git python curl \
    gmake autoconf automake libltdl libtool \
    valgrind \
    cppcheck \
    pkgconf \
    gcc clang

# NOTE: For python, you may eventually have to specify a variant like this
# (numbers depending on default or additional packages of your distro):
#   :; pkg_add python-2.7.15p0
# and/or:
#   :; pkg_add python-3.6.6p1
# although you might succeed specifying shorter names and the packager
# will offer a list of matching variants (as it does for "python" above).
# NOTE: "perl" is not currently a package, but seemingly part of base OS.
# You can find a list of what is (pre-)installed with:
#   :; pkg_info | grep -Ei 'perl|python'

# For spell-checking, highly recommended if you would propose pull requests:
:; pkg_add \
    aspell

# For other doc types (man-page, PDF, HTML) generation - massive packages (TEX, X11):
:; pkg_add \
    asciidoc source-highlight py-pygments dblatex \
    docbook2x docbook-to-man

# For CGI graph generation - massive packages (X11):
:; pkg_add \
    gd

:; pkg_add \
    cppunit \
    openssl nss \
    augeas \
    libusb1 \
    neon \
    net-snmp \
    avahi

# Select a LUA-5.1 (or possibly 5.2?) version
:; pkg_add \
    lua

:; pkg_add \
    dash ksh93

:; pkg_add \
    argp-standalone \
    freeipmi
------

Recommended:
------
:; pkg_add ccache
:; ( mkdir -p /usr/lib/ccache && cd /usr/lib/ccache && \
        for TOOL in cpp gcc g++ clang clang++ clang-cpp ; do \
            ln -s ../../local/bin/ccache "$TOOL" ; \
        done ; \
   )

:; ( cd /usr/bin && for T in gcc g++ cpp ; do ln -s "$T" "$T-4.2.1" ; done )
:; ( cd /usr/lib/ccache && for T in gcc g++ cpp ; do ln -s "$T" "$T-4.2.1" ; done )

:; ( cd /usr/bin && for T in clang clang++ clang-cpp ; do ln -s "$T" "$T-7.0.1" ; done )
:; ( cd /usr/lib/ccache && for T in clang clang++ clang-cpp ; do ln -s "$T" "$T-7.0.1" ; done )
------

For compatibility with common setups on other operating systems, can add
dash-number suffixed symlinks to compiler tools (e.g. `gcc-4.2.1` beside
`gcc` installed by package) into `/usr/lib/ccache`.

NOTE: For Jenkins agents, also need to `pkg_add jdk` (if asked, pick version
11 or 17); can request `pkg_add jdk%11`. You would likely have to update
the trusted CA store to connect to NUT CI, see e.g. (raw!) download from
https://gist.github.com/galan/ec8b5f92dd325a97e2f66e524d28aaf8
but ensure that you run it with `bash` and it does `wget` the certificates
(maybe with `--no-check-certificate` option if the OS does not trust current
internet infrastructure either), and revise the suggested certificate files
vs. https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/ and/or comments to that gist.

Due to BSD specific paths *when not using* an implementation of `pkg-config`
or `pkgconf` (so guessing of flags is left to administrator -- TBD in NUT
`m4` scripts), better use this routine to test the config/build:
------
:; ./configure --with-doc=all --with-all --with-cgi \
    --without-avahi --without-powerman --without-modbus \
    ### CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include"
    ### LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/lib"
------

Note the lack of `pkg-config` also precludes `libcppunit` tests, although
they also tend to mis-compile/mis-link with GCC (while CLANG seems okay).

NetBSD 9.2
~~~~~~~~~~

Instructions below assume that `pkgin` tool (pkg-src component to
"install binary packages") is present on the system. Text below
was prepared with a VM where "everything" was installed from the
ISO image, including compilers and X11. It is possible that some
packages provided this way differ from those served by `pkgin`,
or on the contrary, that the list of suggested tool installation
below would not include something a bare-minimum system would
require to build NUT.

Note that `PATH` for builds on NetBSD should include `local` and
`pkg`; the default after installation of the test system was:

------
:; PATH="/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/pkg/sbin:/usr/pkg/bin:/usr/X11R7/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin"
:; export PATH
------

NOTE: You may want to reference `ccache` even before all that,
as detailed below:

------
:; PATH="/usr/lib/ccache:$PATH"
:; export PATH
------

To use the `ci_build.sh` don't forget `bash` which is not part of OpenBSD
base installation. It is not required for "legacy" builds arranged by just
`autogen.sh` and `configure` scripts.

------
:; pkgin install \
    git python27 python39 perl curl \
    make gmake autoconf automake libltdl libtool \
    cppcheck \
    pkgconf \
    gcc7 clang

;; ( cd /usr/pkg/bin && ( ln -fs python2.7 python2 ; ln -fs python3.9 python3 ) )
# You can find a list of what is (pre-)installed with:
#   :; pkgin list | grep -Ei 'perl|python'

# For spell-checking, highly recommended if you would propose pull requests:
:; pkgin install \
    aspell aspell-en

# For man-page doc types, footprint on this platform is moderate:
:; pkgin install \
    asciidoc

# For other doc types (PDF, HTML) generation - massive packages (TEX, X11):
:; pkgin install \
    source-highlight py39-pygments dblatex

# For CGI graph generation - massive packages (X11):
:; pkgin install \
    gd openmp

:; pkgin install \
    cppunit \
    openssl nss \
    augeas \
    libusb libusb1 \
    neon \

    avahi

# Select a LUA-5.1 (or possibly 5.2?) version
:; pkgin install \
    lua51

:; pkgin install \
    bash dash ast-ksh oksh
------

[NOTE]
======
(TBD) On NetBSD 9.2 this package complains that it requires
OS ABI 9.0, or that `CHECK_OSABI=no` is set in `pkg_install.conf`.
Such file was not found in the test system...

------
:; pkgin install \
    openipmi
------
======

Recommended: For compatibility with common setups on other operating
systems, can add dash-number suffixed symlinks to compiler tools (e.g.
`gcc-7` beside the `gcc` installed by package) near the original
binaries and into `/usr/lib/ccache`:
------
:; ( cd /usr/bin && for TOOL in cpp gcc g++ ; do \
        ln -s "$TOOL" "$TOOL-7" ; \

        done ; \
   )

NOTE: For Jenkins agents, also need to `pkgin install openjdk11` (will be
in `JAVA_HOME=/usr/pkg/java/openjdk11`).

OpenIndiana 2021.10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that due to IPS and `pkg(5)`, a version of python is part of baseline
illumos-based OS; this may not be the case on some other illumos distributions
which do not use IPS however. Currently they use python 3.7 or newer.

To build older NUT releases (2.7.4 and before), you may need to explicitly
`pkg install python-27`.

Typical tooling would include:

------
:; pkg install \
    git curl wget \
    gnu-make autoconf automake libltdl libtool \
    valgrind \
    pkg-config \
    gnu-binutils developer/linker

# NOTE: For python, some suitable version should be available since `pkg(5)`
# tool is written in it. Similarly, many system tools are written in perl
# so some version should be installed. You may specify additional variants
# like this (numbers depending on default or additional packages of your
# distro; recommended to group `pkg` calls with many packages at once to
# save processing time for calculating a build strategy):
#   :; pkg install runtime/python-27
# and/or:
#   :; pkg install runtime/python-37 runtime/python-35 runtime/python-39
# Similarly for perl variants, e.g.:
#   :; pkg install runtime/perl-522 runtime/perl-524 runtime/perl-534
# You can find a list of what is available in remote repositories with:
#   :; pkg info -r | grep -Ei 'perl|python'

# For spell-checking, highly recommended if you would propose pull requests:
:; pkg install \
    aspell text/aspell/en

# For other doc types (man-page, PDF, HTML) generation - massive packages (TEX, X11):
:; pkg install \
    asciidoc libxslt \
    docbook/dtds docbook/dsssl docbook/xsl docbook docbook/sgml-common pygments-39 \
    graphviz expect graphviz-tcl

# For CGI graph generation - massive packages (X11):
:; pkg install \
    gd

:; pkg install \
    openssl library/mozilla-nss \
    library/augeas python/augeas \
    libusb-1 libusbugen system/library/usb/libusb system/header/header-usb driver/usb/ugen \
    libmodbus \
    neon \
    net-snmp \
    powerman \
    freeipmi \
    avahi

:; pkg install \
    lua

:; pkg install \
    dash bash shell/ksh93

### Maybe
:; pkg install \
    gnu-coreutils

### Maybe - after it gets fixed for GCC builds/linkage
:; pkg install \
    cppunit
------

For extra compiler coverage, we can install a large selection of versions,
although to meet NUT CI farm expectations we also need to expose "numbered"
filenames, as automated below:
------
:; pkg install \
    gcc-48 gcc-49 gcc-5 gcc-6 gcc-7 gcc-9 gcc-10 gcc-11 \
    clang-80 clang-90 \
    ccache

# As of this writing, clang-13 refused to link (claiming issues with
# --fuse-ld which was never specified) on OI; maybe later it will:
:; pkg install \
    developer/clang-13 runtime/clang-13

# Get clang-cpp-X visible in standard PATH (for CI to reference the right one),
# and make sure other frontends are exposed with versions (not all OI distro
# releases have such symlinks packaged right), e.g.:
:; (cd /usr/bin && for X in 8 9 13 ; do for T in "" "++" "-cpp"; do \
    ln -fs "../clang/$X.0/bin/clang$T" "clang${T}-${X}" ; \
   done; done)

# If /usr/lib/ccache/ symlinks to compilers do not appear after package
# installation, or if you had to add links like above, call the service:
:; svcadm restart ccache-update-symlinks
------

We can even include a `gcc-4.4.4-il` version (used to build the illumos OS
ecosystems, at least until recently, which is a viable example of an old
GCC baseline); but note that so far it conflicts with `libgd` builds at
`./configure --with-cgi` stage (its binaries require newer ecosystem):

------
:; pkg install \
    illumos-gcc@4.4.4

# Make it visible in standard PATH
:; (cd /usr/bin && for T in gcc g++ cpp ; do \
    ln -s ../../opt/gcc/4.4.4/bin/$T $T-4.4.4 ; \
   done)

# If /usr/lib/ccache/ symlinks to these do not appear, call the service:
:; svcadm restart ccache-update-symlinks
------

OI currently also does not build `cppunit`-based tests well, at least
not with GCC (they segfault at run-time with `ostream` issues); a CLANG
build works for that however.

It also lacks out-of-the-box Tex suite and `dblatex` in particular, which
`asciidoc` needs to build PDF documents. It may be possible to add these
from third-party repositories (e.g. SFE) and/or build from sources.

No pre-packaged `cppcheck` was found, either.

NOTE: For Jenkins agents, also need to `pkg install runtime/java/openjdk11`
for JRE/JDK 11. Java 11 or 17 is required to run Jenkins agents after
summer 2022.

OmniOS CE (as of release 151036)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Being a minimal-footprint system, OmniOS CE provides very few packages out
of the box. There are additional repositories supported by the project, as
well as third-party repositories such as SFE. For some dependencies, it may
happen that you would need to roll and install your own builds in accordance
with that project's design goals.

Note you may need not just the "Core" IPS package publisher, but also the
"Extra" one. See OmniOS CE web site for setup details.

------
:; pkg install \
    developer/build/autoconf developer/build/automake developer/build/libtool \
    build-essential ccache git developer/pkg-config \
    runtime/perl \
    asciidoc \
    libgd

:; pkg install \
    net-snmp

# NOTE: For python, some suitable version should be available since `pkg(5)`
# tool is written in it. You may specify an additional variant like this
# (numbers depending on default or additional packages of your distro):
#   :; pkg install runtime/python-37
# You can find a list of what is available in remote repositories with:
#   :; pkg info -r | grep -Ei 'perl|python'
------

Your OmniOS version may lack a pre-packaged libusb, however the binary
build from contemporary OpenIndiana can be used (copy the header files
and the library+symlinks for all architectures you would need).

NOTE: As of July 2022, a `libusb-1` package recipe was proposed for the
`omnios-extra` repository (NUT itself and further dependencies may also
appear there, per
link:https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1498[issue #1498]).

You may need to set up `ccache` with the same `/usr/lib/ccache` dir used
in other OS recipes. Assuming your Build Essentials pulled GCC 9 version,
and ccache is under `/opt/ooce` namespace, that would be like:
------
:; mkdir -p /usr/lib/ccache
:; cd /usr/lib/ccache
:; ln -fs ../../../opt/ooce/bin/ccache gcc
:; ln -fs ../../../opt/ooce/bin/ccache g++
:; ln -fs ../../../opt/ooce/bin/ccache gcpp
:; ln -fs ../../../opt/ooce/bin/ccache gcc-9
:; ln -fs ../../../opt/ooce/bin/ccache g++-9
:; ln -fs ../../../opt/ooce/bin/ccache gcpp-9
------

Given that many of the dependencies can get installed into that namespace,
you may have to specify where `pkg-config` will look for them (note that
library and binary paths can be architecture bitness-dependent):
------
:; ./configure PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/ooce/lib/amd64/pkgconfig" --with-cgi
------

Note also that the minimal footprint nature of OmniOS CE precludes building
any large scope easily, so avoid docs and "all drivers" unless you provide
whatever they need to happen.

NOTE: For Jenkins agents, also need to `pkg install runtime/java/openjdk11`
for JRE/JDK 11. Java 11 or 17 is required to run Jenkins agents after
summer 2022.

MacOS with homebrew
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some CI tests happen on MacOS using a mix of their default xcode environment
for compilers, and Homebrew community packaging for dependencies (including
`bash` since the system one is too old for `ci_build.sh` script syntax).

See `.travis.yml` and `.circleci/config.yml` for practical details of the
setup.

Currently known dependencies for basic build include:
----
# Optional for a quick spin:
:; HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1; export HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE

# Required:
:; brew install ccache bash libtool pkg-config gd libusb neon net-snmp openssl
----

Note that ccache is installed in a different location than expected by default
in the `ci_build.sh` script, so if your system allows to add the symbolic link
to `/usr/local/opt/ccache/libexec` as `/usr/lib/ccache` -- please do so as the
easiest way out. Alternatively, to prepare building sessions with `ci_build.sh`
you can:
----
:; export CI_CCACHE_SYMLINKDIR="/usr/local/opt/ccache/libexec"
----


Windows builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There have been several attempts to adjust NUT codebase to native builds
for Windows, as well as there are many projects helping to produce portable
programs.

Further TODO for Windows would include:

* MSVCRT (ubiquitous) vs UCRT (more standards compliant, but since Windows 10)
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/porting/upgrade-your-code-to-the-universal-crt?view=msvc-160

* libusb-0.1 vs libusb-1.0

NOTE: Native mingw, MSYS2, etc. builds on Windows are known to suffer from
interaction with antivirus software which holds executable files open and
so not writable by the linker. This may cause random steps in the `configure`
script or later during the build to fail. If that happens to you, disable the
antivirus completely or exempt at least the NUT build area from protection.

Windows with mingw
------------------

See `scripts/Windows/README` for original recommendations for the effort,
including possibilities of cross-builds with mingw available in Linux.

Unfortunately these did not work for me at the time of testing, yielding
some issues downloading mingw both in Windows and Linux environments.
So I explored other downloads, as detailed below.

See also:

* https://winlibs.com/
* https://azrael.digipen.edu/~mmead/www/public/mingw/
* https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/

NOTE: Seems the mingw installer has problems with current authentication
and redirect on SourceForge. You can download and unpack 7z archives from
https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/mingw-w64/mingw-w64-release/
into e.g. `C:\Progra~1\mingw-w64\x86_64-8.1.0-release-posix-seh-rt_v6-rev0`
location on your Windows system. Then for building further NUT dependencies
see `scripts/Windows/README`.

Windows with MSYS2
------------------

The MSYS2 ecosystem is available at https://www.msys2.org/ and builds upon
earlier work by link:https://www.mingw-w64.org[MinGW-w64] (in turn a fork
of link:https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/[MinGW.org (aka mingw-w32)])
and link:http://cygwin.com/[Cygwin] projects, to name a few related efforts.
It also includes `pacman` similar to that in Arch Linux for easier dependency
installation, and many packages are available "out of the box" this way.

The project is currently sponsored by Microsoft and seems to be supported by
Visual Studio Code IDE for building and debugging projects, for more details
see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw

Notable pages of the project include:

* https://www.msys2.org/ with current download link and first-installation
  instructions
* https://www.msys2.org/wiki/MSYS2-introduction/ for general overview
* https://packages.msys2.org/search?t=binpkg for search in package repository

After downloading and installing MSYS2 archive for the first time, they
suggest to start by updating the base ecosystem (using their terminal):
----
:; pacman -Syu
----

Wait for metadata and base package downloads, agree that all MSYS2 programs
including your terminal would be closed/restarted, and wait for this stage
to complete.

Run it again to refresh more of the ecosystem, now without restarting it:
----
:; pacman -Syu
----

Finally, install tools and prerequisites for building NUT; note that some
of the recommended package names are "umbrellas" for several implementations,
and the `pacman` would ask you which (or "all") to install in those cases.

NOTE: Suggestions below use `x86_64` generic variants where possible, and
`clang` where available to try both build toolkits on the platform. If you
want to build `i686` (32-bit) or alternate backends (e.g. `ucrt` instead
of default `msvcrt`), poke the repository search to see what is available.

NOTE: To build NUT with `ci_build.sh` (and generally -- to help `configure`
script find the dependencies listed below), start the terminal session with
"MSYS2 MinGW x64" shortcut. Other options set up the environment variables
for toolkits listed in their shortcut names, and so tend to prefer "wrong"
flags and paths to dependencies (if you have several variants installed).
The "MSYS2 MinGW UCRT x64" was also reported to work.

To avoid toolkit variant mismatches, you may require to use their specific
builds preferentially:
----
PATH="/mingw64/bin:$PATH"
export PATH
----
...and also add these lines to the `~/.bashrc` file.

----


`ccache` wrapper scripts are available as e.g. `/mingw64/lib/ccache/bin/gcc`
and lack a set for `clang` tools; easy-peasy fix with:

----
:; cd /mingw64/lib/ccache/bin
:; for T in clang clang++ clang-cpp ; do sed "s/gcc/$T/" < gcc > "$T" ; chmod +x "$T" ; done
----

Note that default `ccache` seems quirky on Windows MSYS2, possibly due to
mixing of the path separator characters and/or embedding and choking on
the `C:` in path names. Overall it seems unable to create the cache files
after it has created the cache directory tree (though you might have to
pre-create the `${HOME}/.ccache` anyway, as NUT `ci_build.sh` script does.
As found in experimentation, setting the `PATH` consistently for toolkits
involved is very important.

* https://github.com/ccache/ccache/discussions/784
* https://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/tickets/253/

Notable packages not found in the repo:

* snmp (net-snmp, ucd-snmp)
* libregex (C version, direct NUT `configure` script support was added by
  the Windows branch); MSYS2 however includes `libpcre` pulled by some
  of the dependencies above...
* augeas
* avahi
* powerman
* ipmi

Not installed above (yet?):

* https://packages.msys2.org/search?t=binpkg&q=serial
  -- for these need to first check if termios is part of baseline

Note that `ccache` symlinks for MSYS2 are installed into `/usr/lib/ccache/bin`
directory (not plain `/usr/lib/ccache` as elsewhere).

NOTE: After you successfully build NUT (perhaps using `ci_build.sh`), if you
install it into a prototype area by `make DESTDIR=... install` then you should
add the third-party shared libraries involved, for that file set to be usable.
Something along these lines:
------
:; find "$DESTDIR" -name '*.exe' -type f  | while read F ; do ldd "$F" \
   | grep ' /mingw64/' ; done  | awk '{print $3}' | sort | uniq \
   | while read LIB ; do cp -pf "$LIB" "$DESTDIR/mingw64/bin/" ; done
------
Keep in mind that a similar trick (or links to `*.dll` -- and symlinks are
problematic on that platform) may be needed in other directories, such as
`sbin` and `cgi-bin`:
------
:; ( cd "$DESTDIR/mingw64/bin/" && ln *.dll ../sbin && ln *.dll ../cgi-bin )
------

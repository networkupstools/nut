Prerequisites for building NUT on different OSes
================================================
endif::website[]

This chapter aims to list packages with the tools needed on a freshly minimally
deployed worker to build as many targets of NUT recipes as possible, mainly
the diverse driver and documentation types.

NUT codebase generally should not depend on particular operating system or
kernel technology and version, and with the operating systems listed below
one can benefit from use of containers (jails, zones) to build and test
against numerous OS distributions on one physical or virtual machine,
e.g. to cover non-regression with older tool kits while taking advantage
of new releases.

* For Linux systems, we have notes on link:ci-farm-lxc-setup.txt[Setting
  up the multi-arch Linux LXC container farm for NUT CI]

Some of the below are alternatives, e.g. compiler toolkits (gcc vs. clang)
or SSL implementations (OpenSSL vs Mozilla NSS) -- no problem installing
both, at a disk space cost.

NOTE: Some NUT branches may need additional or different software versions
that are not yet included into `master` branch dependencies, e.g. the DMF
(Dynamic Mapping Files) sub-project needs LUA 5.1.

More packages and/or system setup may be needed to actually run NUT with
all features enabled; chapters below concern just with building it.

General call to Test the ability to configure and build
-------------------------------------------------------

Check out from git, generate files and configure to tailor to your build
environment, and build some tests:

----
:; mkdir -p nut && cd nut && \
   git clone https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/ -b fightwarn .
:; ./autogen.sh && \
    ./configure --with-doc=all --with-all --with-cgi && \
    make all && make check && make spellcheck
----

NOTE: You can toggle some build options to check different dependency
variants, e.g. `--with-ssl=nss` vs. `--with-ssl=openssl`

NOTE: For reproducible runs of various pre-sets of configuration during
development, take a look at `ci_build.sh` script and different `BUILD_TYPE`
(and other) environment variable settings that it supports. A minimal run
with it is just:
+
----
:; mkdir -p nut && cd nut && \
   git clone https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/ -b fightwarn .
:; ./ci_build.sh
----

NOTE: To build older releases, such as "vanilla" NUT 2.7.4, you may need to:

* Ensure that `python` in `PATH` points to a python-2.x implementation
  (`master` branch is fixed to work with python 2 and 3)

* Ensure that `bash` is your user and maybe system shell (or ensure the
  generated `configure` script gets interpreted by it)

* Generally you may have better results with GNU Make newer than 3.81
  than with other make implementations

* For intensive rebuilds, `ccache` is recommended

* Parallel builds should be okay in current development version (is a bug
  to log, if not), but may be failure-prone in 2.7.4 and earlier releases

Debian 10/11
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Being a popular baseline among Linux distributions, Debian is an important
build target. Related common operating systems include Ubuntu and customized
distros for Raspberry Pi, as well as many others. The package list below
should largely apply to those as well, however note that some well-known
package names tend to differ. A few of those are noted below.

----
:; apt-get update

# NOTE: Older Debian-like distributions may lack a "libtool-bin"
:; apt-get install \
    ccache time \
    git python curl \
    make autoconf automake libltdl-dev libtool-bin libtool \
    valgrind \
    cppcheck \
    pkg-config \
    gcc g++ clang \
    asciidoc source-highlight python3-pygments dblatex aspell \
    libgd-dev

# NOTE: Some Debian-like distributions, e.g. Ubuntu, ship
# a "libssl-dev" instead of "openssl-dev" by name
:; apt-get install \
    libcppunit-dev \
    openssl-dev libnss3-dev \
    augeas-tools libaugeas-dev augeas-lenses \
    libusb-dev \
    libi2c-dev \
    libmodbus-dev \
    libsnmp-dev \
    libpowerman0-dev \
    libfreeipmi-dev libipmimonitoring-dev \
    libavahi-common-dev libavahi-core-dev libavahi-client-dev
# For libneon, see below

:; apt-get install \
    lua5.1-dev

:; apt-get install \
    bash dash ksh busybox
----

Alternatives that can depend on your system's other packaging choices:
----
:; apt-get install libneon27-dev
# ... or
:; apt-get install libneon27-gnutls-dev
----

Over time, Debian and Ubuntu had different packages and libraries providing
the actual methods for I2C; if your system lacks the `libi2c` (and so fails
to `./configure --with-all`), try adding the following packages:
+
----
:; apt-get install build-essential git-core libi2c-dev i2c-tools lm-sensors
----

For cross-builds (note that not everything supports multilib approach,
limiting standard package installations to one or another implementation;
in that case local containers each with one ARCH may be a better choice,
with `qemu-user-static` playing a role to "natively" run the other-ARCH
complete environments):
----
:; apt-get install \
    gcc-multilib g++-multilib \
    crossbuild-essential \
    gcc-10:armhf gcc-10-base:armhf \
    qemu-user-static
----

NOTE: For Jenkins agents, also need to `apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk-headless`
(technically, needs at least JRE 8+).

FreeBSD 12.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that `PATH` for builds on BSD should include `local`:

----
:; PATH=/usr/local/libexec/ccache:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:$PATH
:; export PATH
----

NOTE: You may want to reference `ccache` even before all that, as detailed
below.

----
:; pkg install \
    git python curl \
    gmake autoconf automake autotools libltdl libtool \
    valgrind \
    cppcheck \
    pkgconf \
    gcc clang \
    asciidoc source-highlight textproc/py-pygments dblatex en-aspell aspell \
    libgd

:; pkg install \
    cppunit \
    openssl nss \
    augeas \
    libmodbus \
    neon \
    net-snmp \
    powerman \
    freeipmi \
    avahi

:; pkg install \
    lua51

:; pkg install \
    bash dash busybox ksh93
----

Recommended:
----
:; pkg install ccache
:; ccache-update-links
----

For compatibility with common setups on other operating systems, can symlink
`/usr/local/libexec/ccache` as `/usr/lib/ccache` and possibly add dash-number
suffixed symlinks to compiler tools (e.g. `gcc-10` beside `gcc10` installed
by package).

NOTE: For Jenkins agents, also need to `pkg install openjdk8` (or 11+) --
and do note its further OS configuration suggestions for special filesystem
mounts.

Due to BSD specific paths *when not using* an implementation of `pkg-config`
or `pkgconf` (so guessing of flags is left to administrator -- TBD in NUT m4
scripts), better use this routine to test the config/build:
----
:; ./configure --with-doc=all --with-all --with-cgi \
    --without-avahi --without-powerman --without-modbus \
    ### CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/lib"
----

Note the lack of `pkg-config` also precludes libcppunit tests, although they
also tend to mis-compile/mis-link with GCC (while CLANG seems okay).

OpenBSD 6.4
~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that `PATH` for builds on BSD should include `local`:

----
:; PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH
:; export PATH
----

NOTE: You may want to reference `ccache` even before all that, as detailed
below.

OpenBSD delivers many versions of numerous packages, you should specify
your pick interactively or as part of package name (e.g. `autoconf-2.69p2`).

During builds, you may have to tell system dispatcher scripts which version
to use, e.g.: `export AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.69 AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.10`

To use the `ci_build.sh` don't forget `bash` which is not part of OpenBSD
base installation. It is not required for "legacy" builds arranged by just
`autogen.sh` and `configure` scripts.

NOTE: The OpenBSD 6.4 `install64.iso` installation includes a set of packages
that seems to exceed whatever is available on network mirrors; for example,
the CD image included `clang` program while it is not available to `pkg_add`,
at least not via http://ftp.netbsd.hu/mirrors/openbsd/6.4/packages/amd64/
mirror. The `gcc` version on CD image differed notably from that in the
networked repository (4.2.x vs 4.9.x)

----
:; pkg_add \
    git python curl \
    gmake autoconf automake libltdl libtool \
    valgrind \
    cppcheck \
    pkgconf \
    gcc clang \
    asciidoc source-highlight py-pygments dblatex aspell \
    gd

# Need to find proper package name and/or mirror for this:
:; pkg_add clang

:; pkg_add \
    cppunit \
    openssl nss \
    augeas \
    neon \
    net-snmp \
    freeipmi \
    avahi

# Select a LUA-5.1 (or possibly 5.2?) version
:; pkg_add \
    lua

:; pkg_add \
    bash dash busybox ksh93
----

Recommended:
----
:; pkg_add ccache
:; ( mkdir -p /usr/lib/ccache && cd /usr/lib/ccache && \
        for TOOL in cpp gcc g++ clang clang++ clang-cpp ; do \
            ln -s ../../local/bin/ccache "$TOOL" ; \
        done ; \
   )
----

For compatibility with common setups on other operating systems, can add
dash-number suffixed symlinks to compiler tools (e.g. `gcc-4.2.1` beside
`gcc` installed by package) into `/usr/lib/ccache`.

NOTE: For Jenkins agents, also need to `pkg_add jre` or `pkg_add jdk`
(pick version 1.8 or 8, or 11+).

Due to BSD specific paths *when not using* an implementation of `pkg-config`
or `pkgconf` (so guessing of flags is left to administrator -- TBD in NUT m4
scripts), better use this routine to test the config/build:
----
:; ./configure --with-doc=all --with-all --with-cgi \
    --without-avahi --without-powerman --without-modbus \
    ### CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/lib"
----

Note the lack of `pkg-config` also precludes libcppunit tests, although they
also tend to mis-compile/mis-link with GCC (while CLANG seems okay).

OpenIndiana 2021.04
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that due to IPS and `pkg(5)`, a version of python is part of baseline
illumos-based OS; this may not be the case on some other illumos distributions
which do not use IPS however. Currently they use python 3.7 or newer.

To build older NUT releases (2.7.4 and before), you may need to explicitly
`pkg install python-27`.

Typical tooling would include:

----
:; pkg install \
    git curl wget \
    gnu-make autoconf automake libltdl libtool \
    valgrind \
    pkg-config \
    gnu-binutils developer/linker \
    asciidoc libxslt aspell text/aspell/en \
    docbook/dtds docbook/dsssl docbook/xsl docbook docbook/sgml-common pygments-39 \
    graphviz expect gd graphviz-tcl

:; pkg install \
    openssl library/mozilla-nss \
    library/augeas python/augeas \
    libusb-1 libusbugen system/library/usb/libusb system/header/header-usb driver/usb/ugen \
    neon \
    net-snmp \
    powerman \
    freeipmi \
    avahi

:; pkg install \
    lua

:; pkg install \
    dash bash shell/ksh93

### Maybe
:; pkg install \
    gnu-coreutils

### Maybe - after it gets fixed for GCC builds/linkage
:; pkg install \
    cppunit

### Not yet in distro, PR pending:
:; pkg install \
    libmodbus
----

For extra compiler coverage, can also set up `gcc-4.4.4-il` (used to build
the OS, or was recently, and is a viable example of an old GCC baseline);
but note that so far it conflicts with libgd builds at `configure --with-cgi`
stage:
----
:; pkg install \
    illumos-gcc@4.4.4 \
    gcc-48 gcc-49 gcc-5 gcc-6 gcc-7 gcc-9 gcc-10 \
    clang-80 clang-90

:; svcadm refresh clang-update-symlinks
----

OI currently also does not build cppunit-based tests well, at least
not with GCC (they segfault at run-time with `ostream` issues); a CLANG
build works for that however.

It also lacks out-of-the-box Tex suite and `dblatex` in particular, which
`asciidoc` needs to build PDF documents. It may be possible to add these
from third-party repositories (e.g. SFE) and/or build from sources.

No pre-packaged `cppcheck` was found, either.

NOTE: For Jenkins agents, also need to `pkg install developer/java/openjdk8`
(or 11+).

OmniOS CE (as of release 151036)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Being a minimal-footprint system, OmniOS CE provides very few packages out
of the box. There are additional repositories supported by the project, as
well as third-party repositories such as SFE. For some dependencies, it may
happen that you would need to roll and install your own builds in accordance
with that project's design goals.

Note you may need not just the "Core" IPS package publisher, but also the
"Extra" one. See OmniOS CE web site for setup details.

----
:; pkg install \
    developer/build/autoconf developer/build/automake developer/build/libtool \
    build-essential ccache git developer/pkg-config \
    asciidoc \
    libgd

:; pkg install \
    net-snmp
----

OmniOS lacks a pre-packaged libusb, however the binary build from contemporary
OpenIndiana can be used (copy the header files and the library+symlinks for
all architectures you would need).

You may need to set up `ccache` with the same dir used in other OS recipes;
assuming your Build Essentials pulled GCC 9, and ccache is under `/opt/ooce`
namespace, that would be like:
----
:; mkdir -p /usr/lib/ccache
:; cd /usr/lib/ccache
:; ln -fs ../../../opt/ooce/bin/ccache gcc
:; ln -fs ../../../opt/ooce/bin/ccache g++
:; ln -fs ../../../opt/ooce/bin/ccache gcpp
:; ln -fs ../../../opt/ooce/bin/ccache gcc-9
:; ln -fs ../../../opt/ooce/bin/ccache g++-9
:; ln -fs ../../../opt/ooce/bin/ccache gcpp-9
----

Given that many of the dependencies can get installed into that namespace,
you may have to specify where `pkg-config` will look for them (note that
library and binary paths can be architecture bitness-dependent):
----
:; ./configure PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/ooce/lib/amd64/pkgconfig" --with-cgi
----

Note also that the minimal footprint nature of OmniOS CE precludes building
any large scope easily, so avoid docs and "all drivers" unless you provide
whatever they need to happen.

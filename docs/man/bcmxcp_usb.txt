BCMXCP_USB(8)
=============

NAME
----

bcmxcp_usb - Experimental driver for UPSes supporting the BCM/XCP protocol over USB

NOTE
----

This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
bcmxcp_usb driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].
This driver is a variant of the serial driver bcmxcp and uses the same core code.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

This driver should recognize all BCM/XCP-compatible UPSes that are connected
via USB.  It has been developed and tested on Powerware PW3501 hardware. It also has
been tested on PW5110 hardware.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver supports the following optional settings in the
linkman:ups.conf[5].

*shutdown_delay=*'delay'::
The number of seconds that the UPS should wait between receiving the
shutdown command and actually shutting off.

DEFAULT VALUES FOR THE EXTRA ARGUMENTS
--------------------------------------

*shutdown_delay =*'120'

INSTANT COMMANDS
----------------

This driver supports the following Instant Commands:

*shutdown.return*::
Turn off the load and return when power is back.

*shutdown.stayoff*::
Turn off the load and remain off.

*test.battery.start*::
Start a battery test.

TODO LIST
---------

*Report UPS alarm status*::
BCM/XCP supports reporting a wide range of UPS alarm conditions.

*Report UPS statistics information*::
BCM/XCP supports reporting of UPS statistics data.

EXPERIMENTAL DRIVER
-------------------

This driver has been tagged experimental, even if it has been reported
to be stable. Thus it is not suitable for production systems and it is
not built by default. This is mainly due to the fact that it is a
new driver.

INSTALLATION
------------

This driver is not built by default.  You can build it by using
"configure --with-usb=yes". Note that it will also install other USB
drivers.

You also need to install manually the hotplug files (libhidups and
libhid.usermap), generally in etc/hotplug/usb/, to address the
permission settings problem. Lastly note that the libhidups file
must have execution flag set (ie using chmod +x ...).

IMPLEMENTATION
--------------

bcmxcp_usb only supports 1 UPS at this time. You can put the
"auto" value for port in `ups.conf`, i.e.:

	[pw3105]
		driver = bcmxcp_usb
		port = auto

KNOWN ISSUES AND BUGS
---------------------

"Got EPERM: Operation not permitted upon driver startup"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have forgotten to install the hotplug files, as explained
in the INSTALLATION section above. Don't forget to restart
hotplug so that it applies these changes.

PHOENIXCONTACT_MODBUS(8)
========================

NAME
----

phoenixcontact_modbus - Driver for Phoenix Contact

SYNOPSIS
--------

*phoenixcontact_modbus* -h

*phoenixcontact_modbus* -a 'DEVICE_NAME' ['OPTIONS']

NOTE: This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
phoenixcontact_modbus driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

This driver should support the PhoenixContact QUINT-UPS industrial DC UPS, model 2320461 and all compatible models.
More information about this UPS can be found here: https://www.phoenixcontact.com/online/portal/us?uri=pxc-oc-itemdetail:pid=2320461

phoenixcontact_modbus uses the libmodbus project, for Modbus implementation.

How to configure the UPS
------------------------

Note: this UPS and its manual refers to Low-Batt as "Shutdown Event".

You need the "IFS-RS232-DATACABLE" to communicate with the UPS in linux as the IFS-USB cable doesn't seem to be supported. FYI communication parameters are: 115200,E,8,1.
You also need the UPS-CONF Windows software (free; download from their site), to configure the UPS signals and timers.

1. Run the UPS-CONF
2. Go to Settings->Time Setting
3. Choose "state of charge shutdown delay"
4. Choose Remote starts PC-Shutdown in Mains and Battery mode
5. On the PC-Shutdown enter the maximum value (5 minutes)
6. On the PC-Restart delay enter the time you want the UPS to leave the output power off before restarting (e.g. 60 seconds), after mains power is restored.
7. On the UPS, turn the screw to the "PC-MODE" position

Configuring the above way ensures that:

 * When power is lost, UPS constantly calculates remaining battery time
 * When remaining battery time is less than 5 minutes (PC-Shutdown setting), it will raise the "Shutdown" event (seen as LOW-BATT in NUT)
 * From that moment even if input power is restored, the UPS will cut the output power to its load after 5 minutes
 * When the input power is restored, the UPS will restore output power after 60 seconds (PC-RESTART delay setting).

Meaning of settings:

 * PC-Shutdown: How long before output cutoff the UPS will raise the "shutdown event" signal. Max value for this is 5 minutes. So PC should be able to shutdown within 5 minutes.
 * PC-Restart: How long to delay output power after power is restored. Max is 60 seconds.
 

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver doesn't support any optional settings.

INSTALLATION
------------

This driver is not built by default.  You can build it by installing libmodbus
and running `configure --with-modbus=yes`.

You also need to give proper permissions on the local serial device file
(/dev/ttyS0 for example) to allow the NUT user to access it.

INSTANT COMMANDS
----------------

This driver doesn't support any instant commands.

NUT-UPOWER(8)
=============

NAME
----
nut-upower - Driver for UPower devices via D-Bus

SYNOPSIS
--------
*nut-upower* -h

*nut-upower* -a 'UPS_NAME' ['OPTIONS']

NOTE: This man page only documents the specific features of the
*nut-upower* driver. For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This driver allows the monitoring of power devices (UPS, batteries) that are
managed by the UPower daemon via the D-Bus system bus.

It maps UPower properties (state, percentage, voltage, etc.) to standard NUT
variables, allowing NUT clients to monitor devices that are natively supported
by the OS desktop environment but not directly by other NUT drivers.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------
This driver supports the following optional settings in linkman:ups.conf[5]:

*port*::
The UPower Object Path of the device to monitor.

If set to `auto` (the default), the driver will scan for the first UPower device
whose object path contains the string "ups_".

If set to a specific path (e.g., `/org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/ups_hiddev0`),
the driver will attempt to monitor that specific device.

*lowbatt*::
The battery percentage threshold below which the `LB` (Low Battery) status
flag is set. The default value is 20.0.

INSTALLATION
------------
To use this driver, add a section to your *ups.conf*:

----
[myups]
    driver = nut-upower
    port = auto
    lowbatt = 20
    desc = "Laptop Battery or generic UPS via UPower"
----

REQUIREMENTS
------------
This driver requires the `upower` daemon to be running and accessible via the
D-Bus system bus. It also requires GLib 2.0 and GIO libraries.

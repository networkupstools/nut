UPSCLI_INIT_DEFAULT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT(3)
======================================

NAME
----

upscli_init_default_connect_timeout - Initialize upsclient module aspect of default timeout for initial connections.

SYNOPSIS
--------

------
	#include <upsclient.h>

	int upscli_init_default_connect_timeout(
		const char *cli_secs,
		const char *config_secs,
		const char *default_secs);
------

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The *upscli_init_default_connect_timeout()* function initializes upsclient module
aspect of default connection timeout for linkman:upscli_connect[3], which
may be important when e.g. linkman:upsc[1] scripting or linkman:upsmon[8]
configuration refers to unresponsive hosts, or when the host name resolution
lags, etc.  By default, linkman:upscli_connect[3] blocks indefinitely in
its attempts to connect (or until the system transport layer interrupts
such an attempt).

It populates the value from different sources, mostly C strings which represent
a floating-point non-negative number (invalid parsing is logged and may impact
the return value), any or all of them may be `NULL` to skip, and in specific
order (last valid hit wins):

* built-in '0' meaning indefinitely blocking (NUT default for this method over
  at least 20 years);
* the number from `default_secs` as a particular NUT or third-party client
  program's built-in preferred (low-priority) default;
* the number from `NUT_DEFAULT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` environment variable as a
  site-local preference (generally pre-set in linkman:nut.conf[5]);
* the number from `config_secs` as a particular NUT or third-party client
  program's configuration file default;
* the number from `cli_secs` as a particular NUT or third-party client
  program's setting from command line (highest priority).

Internally, calls linkman:upscli_set_default_connect_timeout[3] for most of
the string related processing.

The upsclient module tracks if *upscli_init_default_connect_timeout()* function
was called and succeeded, in order to call it once (if never used) from the
linkman:upscli_connect[3] or linkman:upscli_init[3] methods.  This allows
unmodified (legacy) NUT clients to consistently benefit from presence of
the `NUT_DEFAULT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` environment variable.

This tracking does not preclude programs from explicitly calling the method
any amount of times.

RETURN VALUE
------------

The *upscli_init_default_connect_timeout()* function returns '0' on success (either if
all strings were `NULL` so the built-in default is applied, or at least one of
those strings that were set was valid and its value got applied), or '-1' if
an error occurs (at least one string was not `NULL`, and none of the strings
was valid).

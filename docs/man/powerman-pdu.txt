POWERMAN-PDU(8)
===============

NAME
----

powerman-pdu - Driver for Powerman PDU

SYNOPSIS
--------

*powerman-pdu* -h

*powerman-pdu* -a 'PDU_NAME' ['OPTIONS']

NOTE: This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
powerman-pdu driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

This driver supports a wide range of PDUs through the Powerman project.

This includes various models from APC, Baytech, Cyclades, but also support
IPMI and various blade management modules from HP, IBM and Sun.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver doesn't support any optional settings.

INSTALLATION
------------

This driver is not built by default.  You can build it by using
"configure --with-powerman=yes".

UPS COMMANDS
------------

The following instant commands (see linkman:upscmd[8]) are available for each
outlet of the PDU, with *X* standing for the outlet number:

*outlet.X.load.on*::

Power on the outlet.

*outlet.X.load.off*::

Power off the outlet.

*outlet.X.load.cycle*::

Cycle the outlet (power off then power on, possibly with a delay).

IMPLEMENTATION
--------------

The hostname of the Powerman server is specified using the "port" value in
*ups.conf*, i.e.:

	[pdu]
		driver = powerman-pdu
		port = host.example.com:port

The port used to reach 'powermand' is optional if the default port is used.

KNOWN ISSUES
------------

In the current NUT version (2.4.1), ups.status is still exposed, with the value
"WAIT". Some other values from the
ups collection are also exposed.

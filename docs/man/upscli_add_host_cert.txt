UPSCLI_ADD_HOST_CERT(3)
=======================

NAME
----

upscli_add_host_cert - Register a security rule for an host.

SYNOPSIS
--------

------
	#include <upsclient.h>

	void upscli_add_host_cert(
		const char* hostname,
		const char* certname,
		int certverify,
		int forcessl);
------

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The *upscli_add_host_cert()* function registers a security rule associated
to the 'hostname'. All connections to this host use this rule.

The rule is composed of the certificate name 'certname' expected for
the host, 'certverify' if the certificate must be validated for the host
and 'forcessl' if a secured connection must be used to connect to the host.

NOTE: This call currently only functions if `libupsclient` has been compiled
with NSS support. If instead it was compiled with OpenSSL support, this method
contains an empty definition and will take no action when called. Starting with
NUT v2.8.5, you can use linkman:upscli_ssl_caps[3] from consumer code to query
the library about its build circumstances (whether it supports SSL, and which
backend(s)).

RETURN VALUE
------------

*upscli_add_host_cert()* returns no value.

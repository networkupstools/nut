NAME
----

failover — UPS Failover Driver

SYNOPSIS
--------

*failover* -h

*failover* -a 'UPS_NAME' ['OPTIONS']

NOTE: This man page only documents the specific features of the failover driver.
For information about the core driver, see linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The `failover` driver acts as a smart proxy for multiple "real" UPS drivers. It
connects to and monitors these underlying UPS drivers through their local UNIX
sockets (or Windows named pipes), continuously evaluating health and suitability
for "primary" duty according to a set of user configurable rules and priorities.

At any given time, `failover` designates one UPS driver as the *primary*, and
presents its commands, variables and status to the outside world as if it were
directly talking to that UPS. From the perspective of the clients (such as
linkman:upsmon[8] or linkman:upsc[8]), the `failover` driver behaves like any
single UPS, abstracting away the underlying redundancy, and allowing for
seamless transitioning between all monitored UPS drivers and their datasets.

The driver dynamically promotes or demotes the primary UPS driver based on:

- Socket availability and communication status
- Data freshness and UPS online/offline indicators
- User-defined status filters (e.g., presence or absence of `OL`, `LB`, ...)
- Administrative override via control commands (`force.primary`, `force.ignore`)

If the current primary becomes unavailable or no longer meets the criteria, the
driver automatically fails over to a more suitable driver. During transitions,
it ensures that any data is switched out instantly, without the linkman:upsd[8]
considering it as stale or the clients acting on any previously degraded status.

When no suitable primary is available, a configurable fallback state is entered:

- Keep last primary and declare the data as stale
- Raise `ALARM` and declare the data as stale
- Raise `ALARM` and set forced shutdown (`FSD`)

Different communication media can be used to connect to individual UPS drivers
(e.g., USB, Serial, Ethernet). `failover` communicates directly at the socket
level and therefore does not rely on linkman:upsd[8] being active.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver supports the following settings:

*port*='drivername-devicename,drivername2-devicename2,...'::
Required. Specifies the local socket names (or Windows named pipes) of the
underlying UPS drivers to be tracked. Entries must follow the format
`drivername-devicename`, as used by NUT's internal socket naming convention
(e.g. `usbhid-ups-ups1`). Multiple entries are comma-separated with no spaces.

*inittime*='seconds'::
Optional. Sets a grace period after driver startup during which the absence of a
primary UPS is tolerated. This allows time for underlying drivers to initialize.
Defaults to 30 seconds.

*deadtime*='seconds'::
Optional. Sets a grace period in seconds after which a non-responsive UPS driver
is considered dead. Defaults to 30 seconds.

*relogtime*='seconds'::
Optional. Time interval in which repeated connection failure logs are emitted
for a UPS, reducing log spam during unstable conditions. Defaults to 5 seconds.

*noprimarytime*='seconds'::
Optional. Duration to wait without a suitable primary UPS driver before entering
the configured fallback mode (`fsdmode`). Defaults to 15 seconds.

*maxconnfails*='count'::
Optional. Number of consecutive connection failures allowed per UPS driver
before entering into the cooldown period (`coolofftime`). Defaults to 5.

*coolofftime*='seconds'::
Optional. Cooldown period during which the driver pauses reconnect attempts
after exceeding `maxconnfails`. Defaults to 15 seconds.

*fsdmode*='0|1|2'::
Optional. Defines the behavior when no suitable primary UPS driver is found
after `noprimarytime` has elapsed. Defaults to 0.

- `0`: *Do not demote the last primary, but mark its data as stale.* This is
similar to how a regular UPS driver would behave when it loses its connection to
the target UPS device. linkman:upsmon[8] will act on the last known (online or
not) status, and decide itself whether that UPS should be considered critical.

- `1`: *Demote the primary, raise `ALARM`, and mark the data as stale after an
additional few seconds have elapsed (ensuring full propagation).* This will
cause linkman:upsmon[8] to detect that a device previously in an alarm state has
lost its connection, consider the UPS driver critical, and possibly trigger a
forced shutdown (`FSD`) due to depletion of `MINSUPPLIES`.

- `2`: *Demote the primary, raise `ALARM`, and immediately set `FSD`.* This will
set `FSD` from the driver side and preempt linkman:upsmon[8] from raising it
itself. This mode is for setups where immediate shutdown is warranted,
regardless of anything else, and getting `FSD` out to the clients as fast as
just possible.

*strictfiltering*='0|1':: Optional. If set to 1, only UPS drivers matching the
configured status filters are considered for promotion to primary. If set to 0,
the hard-coded default logic is also considered when no status filters match
(read more about this in the section `PRIORITIES`). Defaults to 0.

*status_have_any*='OL,CHRG,...'::
Optional. If any of these comma-separated tokens are present in a UPS driver's
`ups.status`, it passes this status filtering criteria. Defaults to unset.

*status_have_all*='OL,CHRG,...'::
Optional. All listed comma-separated tokens must be present in `ups.status` for
the UPS driver to pass this status filtering criteria. Defaults to unset.

*status_nothave_any*='OB,OFF,...'::
Optional. If any of these comma-separated tokens are present in `ups.status`,
the UPS driver does not pass this status filtering criteria. Defaults to unset.

*status_nothave_all*='OB,LB,...'::
Optional. If all of these comma-separated tokens are present in `ups.status`,
the UPS driver does not pass this status filtering criteria. Defaults to unset.

NOTE: The `status_*` arguments are primarily intended to adjust the weighting of
UPS drivers, allowing some to be prioritized over others based on their status.
For example, a driver reporting `OL` might be preferred over one reporting
`ALARM OL`. While `strictfiltering` can be enabled, status filters are most
effective when used in combination with the default set of connectivity-based
`PRIORITIES`. For more details, see the respective section further below.

IMPLEMENTATION
--------------

The port argument in the linkman:ups.conf[5] should reference the local driver
sockets (or Windows named pipes) that the "real" UPS drivers are using. A basic
default setup with multiple drivers could look like this:

------
  [realups]
     driver = usbhid-ups
     port = auto

  [realups2]
     driver = usbhid-ups
     port = auto

  [failover]
     driver = failover
     port = usbhid-ups-realups,usbhid-ups-realups2
------

Any linkman:upsmon[8] clients would be set to monitor the `failover` UPS.

The driver fully supports setting variables and performing instant commands on
the currently elected primary UPS driver, which are proxied and with end-to-end
tracking also being possible (linkman:upscmd[1] and linkman:upsrw[1] `-w`). You
may notice some variables and commands will be prefixed with `upstream.`, this
is to clearly separate the upstream commands from those of `failover` itself.

For your convenience, additional administrative commands are exposed to directly
influence and override the primary election process, e.g. for maintenance:

- `<socketname>.force.ignore [seconds]` prevents the specified UPS driver from
being selected as primary for the given duration, or permanently if a negative
value is used. A value of `0` resets this override and re-enables selection.

- `<socketname>.force.primary [seconds]` forces the specified UPS driver to be
treated with the highest priority for the given duration, or permanently if a
negative value is used. A value of `0` resets this override.

Calling either command without an argument has the same effect as passing `0`,
but only for that specific override — it does not affect the other.

PRIORITIES
----------

As outlined above, primaries are dynamically elected based on their current
state and according to a strict set of user influenceable priorities, which are:

- `0` (highest): UPS driver was forced to the top by administrative command.
- `1`: UPS driver has passed the user-defined status filters.
- `2`: UPS driver has fresh data and is online (in status `OL`).
- `3`: UPS driver has fresh data, but may not be fully online.
- `4` (lowest): UPS driver is alive, but may not have fresh data.

The UPS driver with the highest calculated priority is chosen as primary, ties
are resolved through order of the socket names given within the `port` argument.

For the user-defined status filters, the following internal order is respected:

1. `status_nothave_any` (first)
2. `status_have_all`
3. `status_nothave_all`
4. `status_have_any` (last)

If `strictfiltering` is enabled, priorities 2 to 4 are not applicable.

If no user-defined status filters are set, the priority 1 is not applicable.

NOTE: The base requirement for any election is the UPS socket being connectable
and the UPS driver having published at least one full batch of data during its
lifetime. UPS driver not fulfilling that requirement are always disqualified.

RATIONALE
---------

In complex power environments, presenting a single, consistent source of UPS
information to linkman:upsmon[8] is sometimes preferable to monitoring multiple
independent drivers directly. The `failover` driver serves as a bridge, allowing
linkman:upsmon[8] to make decisions based on the most suitable available data,
without having to interpret conflicting inputs or degraded sources.

Originally designed for use cases such as dual-PSU systems or redundant
communication paths to a single UPS, `failover` also supports more advanced
setups — for example, when multiple UPSes feed a shared downstream load (via
STS/ATS switches), or when drivers vary in reliability. In these cases, the
driver can be combined with external logic or scripting to dynamically adjust
primary selection and facilitate graceful degradation. Such setups may also
benefit from further integration with the `clone` family of drivers, such as
linkman:clone[8] or linkman:clone-outlet[8], for greater granularity and
monitoring control down to the outlet level.

Ultimately, `failover` enables more nuanced power monitoring and control than
binary online/offline logic alone, allowing administrators to respond to
degraded conditions early — before they escalate into critical events or require
linkman:upsmon[8] to take action.

NUT-DRIVER-ENUMERATOR(8) 
========================

NAME
----

nut-driver-enumerator - tool to map NUT device entries to service instances

SYNOPSIS
--------
*nut-driver-enumerator.sh* -h

*nut-driver-enumerator.sh*  (no args)

*nut-driver-enumerator.sh*  [--COMMAND]


DESCRIPTION
-----------

*nut-driver-enumerator.sh* implements the set-up and querying of the
mapping between NUT driver configuration sections for each individual
monitored device, and the operating system service management framework
service instances into which such drivers are wrapped for independent
execution and management (on platforms where NUT currently supports
this integration -- currently this covers Linux distributions with
systemd and systems derived from Solaris 10 codebase, including
proprietary Sun/Oracle Solaris and numerous open-source illumos
distributions with SMF). It may be not installed in packaging for
other operating systems.

This script provides a uniform interface for further NUT tools
such as linkman:upsdrvsvcctl[8] to implement their logic as
platform-independently as was possible and practical. It is not
currently intended for end-user consumption (and so is located in
the 'libexec' directory), with *upsdrvsvcctl* exposing the most
useful data and actions with its 'list' and 'resync' arguments.

One part of the platform complexity that *nut-driver-enumerator.sh*
hides is the difference of rules for valid service instance names
in various frameworks, as well as system tools and naming patterns
involved.

COMMANDS
--------

*nut-driver-enumerator.sh  (no args)*::
Update wrapping of devices into services

*nut-driver-enumerator.sh --daemon(=freq)*::
Update wrapping of devices into services in an infinite loop;
Default freq is 60 sec.

*nut-driver-enumerator.sh --daemon-after(=freq)*::
Update wrapping of devices into services in an infinite loop;
first do one run of the loop though, then daemonize (this way
service unit is deemed started only when NUT config and driver
instances are in sync). Default freq is 60 sec.

*nut-driver-enumerator.sh --reconfigure*::
Stop and un-register all service instances and recreate them
(e.g. if new dependency template was defined in a new
version of the script or package)

*nut-driver-enumerator.sh  --get-service-framework*::
Print the detected service management framework in this OS

*nut-driver-enumerator.sh  --list-devices*::
Print list of devices in NUT config

*nut-driver-enumerator.sh  --list-services*::
Print list of service instances which wrap registered
NUT devices (full name of service unit)

*nut-driver-enumerator.sh  --list-instances*::
Print list of service instances which wrap registered
NUT devices (just instance suffix)

*nut-driver-enumerator.sh  --get-service-for-device DEV*::
Print the full name of service unit which wraps a NUT
device named `DEV`

*nut-driver-enumerator.sh  --get-device-for-service SVC*::
Print the NUT device name for full or instance-suffix name of
a service unit `SVC` which wraps it

*nut-driver-enumerator.sh  --list-services-for-devices*::
Print a TAB-separated list of service units and corresponding
NUT device names which each such unit wraps

*nut-driver-enumerator.sh --show-all-configs*::
Show the complete normalized list of device configuration blocks
(same as used later by the parser in the script to make decisions)

*nut-driver-enumerator.sh --show-device-config DEV*::
Show configuration block of the specified NUT device

*nut-driver-enumerator.sh --show-device-config-value DEV KEY*::
Show single configuration key of the specified NUT device

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------

By default *nut-driver-enumerator.sh* executed without arguments would
automatically start any newly registered service instances wrapping the
NUT devices, and would also restart the `nut-server` service if the
configuration was changed. Environment variable `AUTO_START=no` disables
this default part of the action.

Also see below for environment variable `REPORT_RESTART_42=no` value.

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------

*nut-driver-enumerator.sh* will return a zero exit code if it had nothing
to do (all currently defined drivers match all of the currently defined
service instances, one-to-one) and if it had no errors in its operation.

Other codes can be returned as a result of re-synchronization of mappings:

*42*::
NUT device sections and system service instances differed before, but
now match up -- so now the caller should likely restart some services.
Note that the drivers' service instances may have been started or stopped
as required (by `AUTO_START=yes`) -- but maybe the upsmon or upssched
services should restart.
If you pass environment variable `REPORT_RESTART_42=no` then
this codepath would return 0 (as a non-error exit code).
In default mode, such non-null reconfiguration should cause
the nut-driver-enumerator service to restart and this would
propagate to other NUT services that depend on it.

*13*::
Sections and services differed, and still do not match up

*1*::
Bad inputs, e.g. unrecognized service management framework

*2*::
Absent or unreadable `ups.conf` file

NOTE
----

This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
everups driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

This driver should recognize the NET *-DPC and AP *-PRO models.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver does not support any extra settings in the
linkman:ups.conf[5].

BUGS

This UPS can only switch off the load if it's running on battery.  This
means you may be vulnerable to power races if your shutdown scripts
don't sleep and force a reboot.

UPSCODE2(8)

NAME
----
upscode2 - Driver for UPScode II compatible UPS equipment

NOTE
----
This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
upscode2 driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------
This driver supports UPS equipment which can be controlled via the UPScode II
protocol.  This is mainly Fiskars, Powerware equipment, but also
some (probably OEM'ed) products from Compaq.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------
This driver supports the following optional settings in the
linkman:ups.conf[5]:

*manufacturer*='value'::
Autodetection of this parameter is not possible yet (and it probably
never will be). Therefore, this user-defined string accepts any name. The
default is 'unknown'.

*input_timeout*='value'::
The timeout waiting for a response from the UPS. Some UPS models have
shown to be rather slow, resulting in frequent messages about empty
responses from the UPS. If you see this, try increasing this value.

*output_pace*='value'::
Delay between characters sent to the UPS. This was added for completeness
with the above parameter. It has not shown to be needed yet.

*baudrate*='value'::
The default baudrate is 1200, which is the standard for the UPScode II
protocol.

*full_update_timer*='value'::
Number of seconds between collection of normative values.

*use_crlf*::
Flag to set if commands towards to UPS need to be terminated with CR-LF,
and not just CR.

*use_pre_lf*::
Flag to set if commands towards to UPS need to be introduced with an LF.
A Compaq T1500h is known to need this.

COMMANDS
--------

The driver supports the following commands for those UPSes that support them.
The available commands are autodetected during initialization,
so you should check availability with 'upscmd -l'.

 * test.panel.start - Start UPS self test

 * test.battery.start - Start battery self test

 * beeper.enable - Enable UPS beeper

 * beeper.disable - Disable UPS beeper

 * shutdown.return - Shut down in 1 second and wait for power to return

 * shutdown.stayoff - Shut down in 1 seconds

 * shutdown.reboot - Shut down in 1 seconds and reboot after 1 minute

 * shutdown.reboot.graceful - Shut down in 20 seconds and reboot after 1 minute

NOTES
-----

The Powerware UPS models that this driver has been tested against until now
have not returned a value for 'battery.charge'. Therefore, the driver will
guestimate a value based on the nominal battery min/max and the current
battery voltage.

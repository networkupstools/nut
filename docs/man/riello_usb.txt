SYNOPSIS
--------

*riello_usb* -h

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

You may need to tweak some settings, depending on the make and model of your
UPS (see linkman:ups.conf[5]):

*localcalculation*::
When enabled, driver will calculate values of `battery.runtime` and
`battery.charge` "locally" in the driver. This is for some Riello models
(iPlug and iDialog series) which provide incorrect values in hardware readings.
This "local calculation" is done according to nominal battery capacity, nominal
battery voltage, actual battery charge, maximum and actual UPS load.
+
You may want to also configure 'default.battery.voltage.low' and
'default.battery.voltage.high' in case the built-in default range
(from 10.7V to 12.9V) does not match your hardware, or give a shot
to 'default.battery.voltage.nominal' (e.g. '24') if your device does
not serve that either.
+
NOTE: Lead (PbAc) battery charge graph is not linear, so guesstimated charge value may
not be perfectly accurate. However it should be good enough to determine battery
actual status and roughly estimate the time it can power the system.
+
WARNING: This keyword may be deprecated in future releases of the driver, in favor of
`runtimecal` and other settings which it requires (as seen in linkman:nutdrv_qx[8],
linkman:blazer_ser[8] and linkman:blazer_usb[8] drivers).
+
NOTE: In this release, such an option is not offered for the sibling
linkman:riello_ser[8] driver.

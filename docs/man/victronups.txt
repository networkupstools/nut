NOTE
----

victronups driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

The victronups driver should recognize all Victron models that use a serial
protocol at 1200 bps.  These include Match Lite, Match and the NetUps line.

The Match Lite line may only report a handful of variables.  This is
usually not a bug - they just don't support anything else.

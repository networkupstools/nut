TRIPPLITESU(8)
==============

NAME
----

tripplitesu - Driver for Tripp-Lite SmartOnline (SU) UPS equipment

SYNOPSIS
--------

*tripplitesu* -h

*tripplitesu* -a 'UPS_NAME' ['OPTIONS']

NOTE: This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
tripplitesu driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

This driver supports the Tripp Lite SmartOnline family (via the serial port).

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver supports the following optional settings in the
linkman:ups.conf[5]:

*lowbatt*='num'::
Set the low battery warning threshold in percent at which shutdown is
initiated by linkman:upsmon[8].  By default, the UPS may not report low battery
until there are only a few seconds left.  Common values are around 25--30.

*command_delay*='milliseconds'::
Set a delay in milliseconds to be applied before each command sent to the UPS.
The default value is 0 (disabled). If experiencing intermittent communication
timeouts when multiple commands are sent in rapid succession, set this to
1000 (1 second) or adjust as needed.

This delay helps prevent "read timeout" errors when the hardware buffer is
not ready to accept new commands immediately after completing the previous one.

MASTERGUARD(8)
==============

NAME
----

masterguard - Driver for Masterguard UPS equipment

SYNOPSIS
--------

*masterguard* -h

*masterguard* -a 'UPS_NAME' ['OPTIONS']

NOTE: This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
masterguard driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

NOTE
----

Please note that this driver is deprecated and will not receive
new development. If it works for managing your devices -- fine,
but if you are running it to try setting up a new device, please
consider the newer linkman:nutdrv_qx[8] instead, which should
handle all 'Q*' protocol variants for NUT.

Please do also report if your device works with this driver,
but linkman:nutdrv_qx[8] would not actually support it with any
subdriver!

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

This driver supports Masterguard UPS equipment (serial connection only).

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

*CS*::
Cancel the shutdown procedure.

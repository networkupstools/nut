NUTSCAN_INIT(3)
===============

NAME
----

nutscan_init - Initialize the nutscan library.

SYNOPSIS
--------

 #include <nut-scan.h>

 void nutscan_init(void);

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The *nutscan_init()* function must be called at least once before using
any other function of the nutscan library.

It updates the following global variables which can be used by nutscan
library user to know which scan methods are available at run-time.

This depends on the libraries installed on the system:

	nutscan_avail_avahi = 1 : AVAHI scan is available
	nutscan_avail_ipmi = 1 : IPMI scan is available
	nutscan_avail_nut = 1 : Old NUT method is available
	nutscan_avail_snmp = 1 : SNMP method is available
	nutscan_avail_usb = 1 : USB method is available
	nutscan_avail_xml_http = 1 : XML HTTP method is available

Note that if a method is reported as unavailable by those variables, the
call to the corresponding `nutscan_scan_*` function will always return NULL.

NOTES
-----

Technically, the function is currently defined in 'nutscan-init.h' file.

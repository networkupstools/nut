BCMXCP(8)
=========

NAME
----

bcmxcp - Driver for UPSes supporting the serial BCM/XCP protocol

NOTE
----

This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
bcmxcp driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

This driver should recognize all serial BCM/XCP-compatible UPSes.  It has
been developed and tested on Powerware PW5115 and PW9120 hardware. If your UPS
has a USB connection, you may also consult the linkman:bcmxcp_usb[8] driver
documentation.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver supports the following optional settings in the
linkman:ups.conf[5].

*shutdown_delay=*'delay'::
The number of seconds that the UPS should wait between receiving the
shutdown command (`upsdrvctl shutdown`) and actually shutting off.

*baud_rate=*'rate'::
Communication speed for the UPS. If this is set to 9600, it tries to connect
to the UPS at 9600bps. If it fails to communicate, it will go into baud-hunting.
It starts at 1200 and goes up to 19200. If it succeeds, it tell you the speed it
connected with. If not included in the config, it defaults to baud-hunting.

DEFAULT VALUES FOR THE EXTRA ARGUMENTS
--------------------------------------

 - *shutdown_delay =* '120'
 - *baud_rate =* 'none'

INSTANT COMMANDS
----------------

This driver supports the following Instant Commands:

*shutdown.return*::
Turn off the load and return when power is back.

*shutdown.stayoff*::
Turn off the load and remain off.

*test.battery.start*::
Start a battery test.

*outlet.n.shutdown.return*::
Turn off the load on outlet 'n' and return when power is back.
('n' is the outlet number reported by the upsc command)

TODO LIST
---------

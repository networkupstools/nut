EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver support the following extra optional settings in the
linkman:ups.conf[5].

*prgshut = 1* - (default = 0, no programmable shutdown )

 * shutdown.return - Shut down in .3 minutes and restart in .3 minutes

 * shutdown.stayoff - Shut down in .3 minutes and do not return

ISSUES
------

The APC version of the Microsol protocol is slightly incompatible with the
*solis* driver. As of version 0.62 of the *solis* driver, the driver will
connect to the UPS, but some values are read incorrectly.

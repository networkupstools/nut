MICROSOL-APC(8)
===============

NAME
----

microsol-apc - Driver for APC Back-UPS BR UPS equipment

SYNOPSIS
--------

*microsol-apc* -h

*microsol-apc* -a 'UPS_NAME' ['OPTIONS']

NOTE: This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
microsol-apc driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

This driver supports the following UPS models:

 * APC Back-UPS BZ1500-BR
 * APC Back-UPS BZ2200I-BR
 * APC Back-UPS BZ2200BI-BR

In 2009, Schneider Electric acquired Microsol Technologies, and by 2012, the
entire Microsol line was being sold under the APC brand. This driver supports
these newer, APC-branded models. Older equipment should use linkman:solis[8].

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver support the following extra optional settings in the
linkman:ups.conf[5].

*battext = n* - (default = 0, no extra battery, where n = Ampere*hour )

*prgshut = 1* - (default = 0, no programmable shutdown )

COMMANDS
--------

 * shutdown.return - Shut down in .3 minutes and restart in .3 minutes

 * shutdown.stayoff - Shut down in .3 minutes and do not return

ISSUES
------

For other APC-Microsol models, the reported voltages, currents and power will
be incorrect, as the communication protocol reports unprocessed data instead of
real values, needing model-specific post-processing by the driver. Monitoring
of UPS state (on-battery/on-line, critical battery) should work for other
models, but is untested.

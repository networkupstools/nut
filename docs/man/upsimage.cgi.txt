UPSIMAGE.CGI(8)
===============

NAME
----

upsimage.cgi - Image-generating helper for upsstats.cgi

SYNOPSIS
--------

*upsimage.cgi*

NOTE: As a CGI program, this should be invoked through your web server.
If you run it from the command line, it will either complain about
unauthorized access or spew a PNG at you.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*upsimage.cgi* generates the graphical bars that make up the right side
of the page generated by linknut:upsstats.cgi[8].  These represent the
current battery charge, utility voltage, and UPS load where available.

The images are in PNG format, and are created by linking to Boutell's
excellent gd library.

ACCESS CONTROL
--------------

upsstats will only talk to linknut:upsd[8] servers that have been defined
in your linknut:hosts.conf[5].  If it complains about "Access to that host
is not authorized", check that file first.

FILES
-----

linknut:hosts.conf[5]

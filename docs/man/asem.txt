NAME

asem - driver for UPS in ASEM PB1300

NOTE
----

This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
*asem* driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

The *asem* driver supports the UPS in ASEM PB1300 embedded PCs. Likely other
I2C devices from the same manufacturer will work too, since this is a "custom"
charger.

Seems that there are two versions of the charger. Older one is based on
Max1667, newer one is a custom solution. Both are on I2C address 0x09.
To be compatible with both versions, the driver just reads bit 15 of address
0x13 which yields online/on battery status.
Battery monitor is a BQ2060 at address 0x0B.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

The required parameter for this driver is the I2C bus name:

*port*='dev-node'::
On the Asem PB1300, this should be `/dev/i2c-7` for the i801 SMBUS adapter.

This driver also supports the following optional settings:

*lb*='num'::
Set the low battery threshold to 'num' volts.

*hb*='num'::
Set the high battery threshold to 'num' volts.

INSTALLATION
------------

This driver is specific to the Linux I2C API, and requires the lm_sensors
libi2c-dev or its equivalent to compile.

Beware that the SystemIO memory used by the I2C controller is reserved by ACPI.
If only a native I2C driver (e.g. i2c_i801, as of 3.5.X Linux kernels) is
available, then you'll need to relax the ACPI resources check. For example, you
can boot with the `acpi_enforce_resources=lax` option.

Optional: use DIAGNOSTICS to describe troubleshooting techniques that are
longer than what can be conveniently described in the driver error messages.

KNOWN ISSUES AND BUGS
---------------------

The driver shutdown function is not implemented, so other arrangements must be
made to turn off the UPS.

HOSTS.CONF(5)
=============

NAME
----

hosts.conf - Access control for Network UPS Tools CGI programs

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The CGI programs (linkman:upsset.cgi[8], linkman:upsstats.cgi[8],
linkman:upsimage.cgi[8]) use this file to determine if they are allowed to
talk to a host.  This keeps random visitors from using your web server
to annoy others by creating outgoing connections.

IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------

* Contents of this file should be pure ASCII (character codes
  not in range would be ignored with a warning message).
* This file does not contain passwords. Read-only monitoring in NUT is
  anonymous, and the linkman:upsset[8] program asks for credentials in
  the browser session when commanding a particular UPS (web-server should
  be secured, as reported to the program by linkman:upsset.conf[5] file).

DIRECTIVES
----------

*MONITOR* 'ups' 'description'::

The 'ups' element is in the form `upsname[@hostname[:port]]`.
+
To allow connections to an UPS called "snoopy" on a system called
"doghouse" that runs `upsd` on port 7877, it would look like this:

	MONITOR snoopy@doghouse:7877 "Joe Cool"
+
The description must be one element, so if it has spaces, then it must
be wrapped with quotes as shown above.  The default hostname is
"localhost".

*CUSTOM_TEMPLATE_LIST* 'filename'::
*CUSTOM_TEMPLATE_SINGLE* 'filename'::

linkman:upsstats[8] allows to use custom HTML template files for some of
its outputs (JSON and "treemode" mark-ups are currently hard-coded in
the binary), which you can specify in the query string part of the
URI (in your `index.html` and/or added cells of `header.html`) as e.g.
------
.../cgi-bin/upsstats.cgi?template_single=custom-s.htm&template_list=custom-l.htm
------
+
Specific file names for a specific role must be permitted with these
directives (can be repeated).  File names must contain the `.htm` sub-string
and must be located directly in the NUT configuration directory (same as
default templates). If custom templates are used in the original request
URI, they will be automatically suffixed to generated links (primarily
`HOSTLINK`, but also just in case added to `TREELINK` and `TREELINK_JSON`,
see linkman:upsstats.html[5] for more details).

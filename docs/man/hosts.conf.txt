HOSTS.CONF(5)
=============

NAME
----

hosts.conf - Access control for Network UPS Tools CGI programs

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The CGI programs (linkman:upsset.cgi[8], linkman:upsstats.cgi[8],
linkman:upsimage.cgi[8]) use this file to determine if they are allowed to
talk to a host.  This keeps random visitors from using your web server
to annoy others by creating outgoing connections.

DIRECTIVES
----------

*MONITOR* 'ups' 'description'::

The 'ups' element is in the form `upsname[@hostname[:port]]`.
To allow connections to a UPS called "snoopy" on a system called
"doghouse" that runs upsd on port 7877, it would look like this:

	MONITOR snoopy@doghouse:7877 "Joe Cool"
+
The description must be one element, so if it has spaces, then it must
be wrapped with quotes as shown above.  The default hostname is
"localhost".

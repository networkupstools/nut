==============

NAME
----

liebert-esp2 - Driver for Liebert UPS, using the ESP-II serial protocol

NOTE
----

This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
liebert-esp2 driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SPECIAL CABLING NOTE
--------------------

Be aware that an RS-232 cable with ONLY the RX, TX and ground pin
must be used when interfacing with GXT2 series UPS units (and possibly others),
since the handshaking lines are used for purposes other than RS-232 flow control.
Use of a standard RS-232 cable with full handshaking may result in
undesired operation and/or shutdown. It is therefore advisable to confirm
the proper cable/wiring with the diagram provided in the manual with your UPS.

* Liebert GXT2-6000RT208

This is an experimental driver.  You have been warned.

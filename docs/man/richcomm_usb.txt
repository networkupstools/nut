RICHCOMM_USB(8)
===============

NAME
----
richcomm_usb - Driver UPS equipment using Richcomm dry-contact to USB
solution

NOTE
----
This man page only documents the specific features of the richcomm_usb
driver.  For information about the core driver, see linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------
The Richcomm dry-contact to USB solution is a generic interface that is
used to upgrade an existing (RS-232) contact closure UPS interface to USB.
As such, all the limitations of the underlying contact closure interface
apply.  This means that you will only get the essentials in ups.status: OL,
OB, and LB.  See also linkman:genericups[8].

BUGS
----
Most contact-closure UPSes will not power down the load if the line power
is present.  This can create a race when using slave linkman:upsmon[8]
systems.  See the linkman:upsmon[8] man page for more information.

The solution to both of these problems is to upgrade to a smart protocol
UPS of some kind that allows detection and proper load cycling on command.

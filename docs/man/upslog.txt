UPSLOG(8)
=========

NAME
----

upslog - UPS status logger

SYNOPSIS
--------

*upslog -h*

*upslog* ['OPTIONS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*upslog* is a daemon that will poll a UPS at periodic intervals, fetch the
variables that interest you, format them, and write them to a file.

The default format string includes variables that are supported by many
common UPS models.  See the description below to make your own.

OPTIONS
-------

*-h*::
Display the help message.

*-f* 'format'::
Monitor the UPS using this format string.  Be sure to enclose
'format' in quotes so your shell doesn't split it up. Valid escapes
within this string are:

%%;; Insert a single "%"

%TIME format%;; Insert the time with strftime formatting

%ETIME%;; Insert the number of seconds, ala time_t.  This is now a
10 digit number.

%HOST%;; insert the local hostname

%UPSHOST%;; insert the host of the UPS being monitored

%PID%;; insert the pid of upslog

%VAR varname%;; insert the value of variable varname
(see NUT developer documentation chapter "Variables" on-line or in
the `docs/nut-names.txt` file in sources of the NUT version you have
installed for more details)

The default format string is:

 %TIME @Y@m@d @H@M@S% %VAR battery.charge% %VAR input.voltage%
 %VAR ups.load% [%VAR ups.status%] %VAR ups.temperature%
 %VAR input.frequency%

*-i* 'interval'::

Wait this many seconds between polls.  This defaults to 30 seconds.
+
If you require tighter timing, you should write your own logger using
the linkman:upsclient[3] library.

*-l* 'logfile'::

Store the results in this file.
+
You can use "-" for stdout, but upslog will remain in the foreground
by default.

*-F*::
upslog will run in the foreground, regardless of logging target.

*-B*::
upslog will run in the background, regardless of logging target.

*-s* 'ups'::
Monitor this UPS.  The format for this option is
+upsname[@hostname[:port]]+.  The default hostname is "localhost".

*-m* 'tuple'::
Monitor multiple UPSs. The format for this option is a tuple of
ups and logfile separated by commas. An example would be:
`upsname@hostname:9999,/var/log/nut/cps.log`

*-u* 'username'::

If started as root, upslog will *setuid*(2) to the user id
associated with 'username' for security.
+
If 'username' is not defined, it will use the value that was compiled into
the program.  This defaults to "nobody", which is less than ideal.

SERVICE DELAYS
--------------

The interval value is merely the number given to *sleep*(3) after running
through the format string.  Therefore, a query will actually take slightly
longer than the interval, depending on the speed of your system.

ON-DEMAND LOGGING
-----------------

Sending a USR1 signal to a running *upslog* process makes it wake from the
current sleep and log immediately.  This is useful when triggered from a
*upssched* event trigger (e.g. `AT ONBATT` or `AT ONLINE`) to ensure that an
entry always exists, even if the power goes away for a period of time shorter
than that specified by the `-i` argument.


LOG ROTATION
------------

*upslog* writes its PID to `upslog.pid`, and will reopen the log file if you
send it a SIGHUP.  This allows it to keep running when the log is rotated
by an external program.

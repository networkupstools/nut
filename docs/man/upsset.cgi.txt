UPSSET.CGI(8)
=============

NAME
----

upsset.cgi - Web-based UPS administration program

SYNOPSIS
--------

*upsset.cgi*

NOTE: As a CGI program, this should be invoked through your web server.
If you run it from the command line, it will sit there until you
give it input resembling a POST request.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*upsset.cgi*
lets you access many administrative functions within the UPS software
from your web browser.  You can change settings and invoke instant
commands where available.

CHANGING SETTINGS
-----------------

Some UPS hardware allows you to change certain variables to other values.
To see what's available, pick a UPS from the chooser and select "settings",
then select "View" to update the page.

You should see a list of items with the descriptions on the left side
and the possible options or input spaces on the right.  After changing
something, be sure to "Save changes" to update the values in your UPS.

If your UPS doesn't support any read/write variables, there will be
nothing to do on this page.

Setting values in read/write variables can also be done from the command
line with linkman:upsrw[8].

INSTANT COMMANDS
----------------

Some UPS hardware also has provisions for performing certain actions at the
user's command.  These include battery tests, battery calibration, front
panel tests (beep!) and more.  To access this section, do as above, but
pick "Commands" as the function.

If your UPS supports any instant commands, they will be listed in a
chooser widget.  Pick the one you like and "Issue command" to make it
happen.

NOTE: some dangerous commands like "Turn off load" may not happen right
away.  This is a feature, not a bug.

The apcsmart driver and some others require that you send this command twice
within a short window in order to make it happen.  This is to keep you from
accidentally killing your systems by picking the wrong one.

To actually turn off the load, you have to send the command once, then
send it again after 3 seconds elapse but before 15 seconds pass.  If
you do it too quickly or slowly, you have to wait at least 3 seconds
but not 15 seconds again.

You can also invoke instant commands from the command line with
linkman:upscmd[8].

ACCESS CONTROL
--------------

It sends commands and settings via the server linkman:upsd[8] to your driver,
which manages the hardware for you.  You must use credentials defined in
linkman:upsd.users[5] file on that data server with appropriate permissions.

upsset will only talk to linkman:upsd[8] servers that have been defined
in your linkman:hosts.conf[8].  If it complains about "Access to that host
is not authorized", check your hosts.conf first.

SECURITY
--------

upsset will not run until you convince it that your CGI directory has
been secured.  This is due to the possibility of someone using upsset
to try password combinations against your linkman:upsd[8] server.

See the example `upsset.conf` file for more information on how you do this.
The short explanation is--if you can't lock it down, don't try to run it.

FILES
-----

linkman:hosts.conf[5], linkman:upsset.conf[5]

MGE-SHUT(8) 
===========

NAME
----

mge-shut - Driver for SHUT Protocol UPS equipment

SYNOPSIS
--------

*mge-shut* -h

*mge-shut* -a 'UPS_NAME' ['OPTIONS']

NOTE: This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
mge-shut driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linknut:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

mge-shut supports all recent Eaton, MGE and Dell UPS models which use the SHUT
(Serial HID UPS Transfer) protocol.

Older MGE models, such as Pulsar ESV+, Pulsar EX and Pulsar ES+, use the U-Talk
protocol and should use the mge-utalk driver.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver also supports the following optional settings:

*lowbatt*='num'::
Set the low battery warning threshold at which shutdown is initiated by
linknut:upsmon[8].
+
The factory default value is 30 (in percent), and can be settable depending on
the exact model.

*offdelay*='num'::
Set the timer before the UPS is turned off after the kill power command is
sent (via the *-k* switch).
+
The default value is 20 (in seconds). Usually this *must be lower* than
'ondelay', but the driver will *not* warn you upon startup if it isn't.
 
*ondelay*='num'::
Set the timer for the UPS to switch on in case the power returns after the
kill power command had been sent but before the actual switch off. This
ensures the machines connected to the UPS are, in all cases, rebooted after
a power failure.
+
The default value is 30 (in seconds). Usually this *must be greater*
than offdelay, but the driver will *not* warn you upon startup if it
isn't. Some UPS'es will restart no matter what, even if the power is
(still) out at the moment this timer elapses. In that case, you could try
if setting 'ondelay = -1' in *ups.conf* helps.

*notification*='num'::
Set notification type to 1 (no), 2 (light) or 3 (yes).
+
The default value is 3 (yes) because of some early Ellipse models which
need it.

KNOWN ISSUES
------------

Repetitive timeout and staleness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some models tends to be unresponsive with the default polling frequency.
The result is that you have some "data stale" errors  in your system log.

In this case, simply modify the general parameter "pollinterval" to a higher
value (like 10 for 10 seconds). This should solve the issue.

Using 'notification=3' might also help.

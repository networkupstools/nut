UPSSET.CONF(5)
==============

NAME
----

upsset.conf - Configuration for Network UPS Tools upsset.cgi

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This file only does one job--it lets you convince linkman:upsset.cgi[8]
that your system's CGI directory is secure.  The program will not run
until this file has been properly defined.

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
---------------------

linkman:upsset.cgi[8] allows you to try login name and password combinations.
There is no rate limiting, as the program shuts down between every request.
Such is the nature of CGI programs.

Normally, attackers would not be able to access your linkman:upsd[8] server
directly as it would be protected by the LISTEN directives in
your linkman:upsd.conf[5] file, tcp-wrappers (if available when NUT was built),
and hopefully local firewall settings in your OS.

*upsset* runs on your web server, so upsd will see it as a connection from
a host on an internal network.  It doesn't know that the connection is
actually coming from someone on the outside.  This is why you must
secure it.

On Apache, you can use the .htaccess file or put the directives in your
httpd.conf.  It looks something like this, assuming the .htaccess
method for older Apache releases:

	<Files upsset.cgi>
	deny from all
	allow from your.network.addresses
	</Files>

You will probably have to set "AllowOverride Limit" for this directory
in your server-level configuration file as well.

Modern Apache enjoys a more detailed syntax, like this:

	ScriptAlias /upsstats.cgi /usr/share/nut/cgi/upsstats.cgi
	ScriptAlias /upsset.cgi /usr/share/nut/cgi/upsset.cgi
	<Directory "/usr/share/nut/cgi">
	      Options +Includes +ExecCGI
	      AllowOverride Limit
	      <RequireAny>
	          Require local
	          Require ip aa.bb.cc.dd/nn
	      </RequireAny>
	</Directory>

If this doesn't make sense, then stop reading and leave this program
alone.  It's not something you absolutely need to have anyway.

Assuming you have all this done, and it actually works (test it!), then
you may add the following directive to this file:

	I_HAVE_SECURED_MY_CGI_DIRECTORY

If you lie to the program and someone beats on your upsd through your
web server, don't blame me.

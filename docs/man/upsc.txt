UPSC(8)
=======


NAME
----
upsc - example lightweight UPS client

SYNOPSIS
--------
*upsc* -l | -L ['host']

*upsc* 'ups' ['variable']

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*upsc* is provided as a quick way to poll the status of a UPS server.  It can
be used inside shell scripts and other programs that need UPS data but don't
want to include the full interface.

OPTIONS
-------
*-l* 'host'::

  List all UPS names configured at 'host', one name per line. The hostname
  defaults to "localhost".  You may optionally add a colon and a port number.

*-L* 'host'::

  As above, list all UPS names configured at 'host', including their description
  provided by the remote upsd(8) from ups.conf(5). The hostname defaults to
  "localhost".  You may optionally add a colon and a port number to override the
  default port.

'ups'::

  Display the status of that UPS.  The format for this option is
  'upsname[@hostname[:port]]'.  The default hostname is "localhost".

'variable'::

  Display the value of this variable only.  By default, upsc retrieves the list
  of variables from the server and then displays the value for each.  This may
  be useful in shell scripts to save an additional pipe into grep.

EXAMPLES
--------

To list all variables on an UPS named "myups" on a host
called "mybox", with upsd(8) running on port 1234:

    $ upsc myups@mybox:1234
    battery.charge: 100.0
    battery.voltage: 13.9
    battery.voltage.nominal: 13.6
    . . .

To list the UPSes configured on this system, along with their descriptions:

    $ upsc -L
    apc: Back-UPS 500
    ppro2: Patriot Pro II

To retrieve the status for all UPSes connected to mybox, using Bourne-shell
syntax:

    $ for UPS in `upsc -l mybox:1234`; do
        upsc $UPS ups.status
    done

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------

upsc will either print a list of UPS names, a list of all supported variables
and their values on the UPS, or an error message.  If you receive an error,
make sure you have specified a valid UPS on the command line, that
linknut:upsd[8] is really running on the other host and that no firewalls are
blocking you.

HISTORY
-------

Earlier versions of this program used the 'upsfetch' library and UDP sockets to
talk to upsd.  This version of upsc uses the new 'upsclient' library, which
only talks TCP.  This is why 'upsct' no longer exists.

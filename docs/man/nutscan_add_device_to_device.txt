NUTSCAN_ADD_DEVICE_TO_DEVICE(3)
===============================

NAME
----

nutscan_add_device_to_device - Concatenate two devices structure.

SYNOPSIS
--------

 #include <nut-scan.h>

 nutscan_device_t * nutscan_add_device_to_device(
       nutscan_device_t * first,
       nutscan_device_t * second);


DESCRIPTION
-----------

The `nutscan_device_t` contains the following variables:

	nutscan_device_type_t   type;
	char *          driver;
	char *          port;
	nutscan_options_t       opt;
	struct nutscan_device * prev;
	struct nutscan_device * next;

This is a double linked list of device. Each device is described by its
`type`, its `driver` name, its `port` and any number of optional data.

The *nutscan_add_device_to_device()* concatenates 'first' and 'second'
devices to a unique device. No new device is created, the two linked
lists are simply linked to each other. So 'first' and 'second' devices
are likely to be modified by this function.

RETURN VALUE
------------

The *nutscan_add_device_to_device()* functions returns a pointer to a
device containing both passed devices. Note that it's not a new device,
so it is either 'first' or 'second' which is returned.

NOTES
-----

Technically, the function is currently defined in 'nutscan-device.h' file.

NAME
----

optiups - Driver for Opti-UPS (Viewsonic) UPS and Zinto D (ONLINE-USV) equipment

SYNOPSIS
--------

*optiups* -h

*optiups* -a 'UPS_NAME' ['OPTIONS']

NOTE: This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
optiups driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

*optiups* was originally written against a PowerES 280es in nut-0.45.  It was
revised for nut-2.0.1 and tested against a PowerES 420E.  It is expected to
work with at least the PowerES, PowerPS, and PowerVS models.

This driver additionally supports a Zinto D from ONLINE USV-Systeme AG
because of their very similar commands, but it is unknown if it also works
with other UPS from them.

This driver will not work with the PowerES stock serial cable.  You will need
to construct your own three conductor cable:

 UPS 6 -> PC 3
 UPS 9 -> PC 2
 UPS 4 -> PC 5

The cable for Online-USV uses pin UPS 7 (not UPS 4) -> PC 5.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver supports the following optional settings in the
linkman:ups.conf[5] file:

*status_only*::

Only poll for critical status information.  Without this, *optiups* (and
all NUT drivers) poll all sorts of information from the UPS fairly often.
It is probably not often enough to hurt anything, so this option probably
is not very useful, unless you have a flaky serial connection or a highly
loaded machine.

*nowarn_noimp*::

Does not print warnings when the UPS reports that a variable is not
implemented or not pollable.  Without the option you will get a message
sent to your system logs each time NUT polls the UPS.  If you specify
*nowarn_noimp*, this message will only be logged once.

*fake_lowbatt*::

This forces the low battery flag true.  Without it, if you want to test
your  UPS, you will have to unplug it and wait until the battery drops
to a low/critical voltage level before NUT will respond and power down
your system.  With the flag, NUT should power down the system soon after
you pull the plug.  When you are done testing, you should remove this flag.
+
For basic shutdown configuration testing, the command 'upsmon -c fsd' is
preferred.

*powerup*::

Zinto D from ONLINE-USV cannot be identified when switched to standby.
Set this flag to allow the driver to power-up your Zinto UPS.
This will also power-up your equipment connected to the UPS!

BUGS
----

On the 420E, `ups.serial` and `ups.temperature` are unsupported features.
This is not a bug in NUT or the NUT driver, just the way things are with
this UPS.

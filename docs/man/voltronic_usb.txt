voltronic_usb - Driver for Voltronic Power USB UPS equipment

NOTE
----
This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the voltronic driver. For information about the core driver, see linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

The voltronic driver should work with various UPSes manufactured by Voltronic
Power and rebranded by Atlantis Land, Cablematic, EAST Power, Emerson Network
Power, EPC/European Power Convertion, EQ Power, FSP, Integra Tech, iTek,
Metartec, Mustek, Neuropower, Nilox, NEW-SAI, Opti-UPS, PowerMatic,
PowerWalker, Salicru, Seltec, Shandy/SHT Power, Start Power, Sweex, Tecnoware,
Tuncmatik, Unitek and many others.  Long story short: if your UPS came with a
software called 'Viewpower', chances are high that it works with this driver.

The NUT compatibility table lists all the known supported models. Keep in mind,
however, that other models not listed there may also be supported, but haven't
been tested.

Devices with a serial interface (use the *voltronic_ser* driver) and with a USB
interface (use the *voltronic_usb* driver) are supported.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

You may want to change some options that control the way the UPS behaves (see linkman:ups.conf[5]):

*ondelay =* 'value'::
Time to wait before switching on the UPS (minutes). It defaults to 0 minutes. [Acceptable range: 0..9999]

*offdelay =* 'value'::
Time to wait before shutting down the UPS (seconds). This value is truncated to units of 6 seconds (less than 60 seconds) or 60 seconds (more than 60 seconds). Defaults to 30 seconds. [Acceptable range: 12..5940]

*stayoff*::
If you set stayoff in ups.conf when FSD arises the UPS will shutdown after *offdelay* seconds and won't return, otherwise (standard behaviour) the UPS will shutdown after *offdelay* seconds and then turn on after *ondelay* minutes (if mains meanwhile returned).

*battpacks =* 'value'::
Set number of battery packs in parallel to n [1..99] (Not available on some hardware.)
This setting will change the runtime estimation reported by the UPS.

*battnumb =* 'value'::
Set number of batteries to n [1..9] (Not available on some hardware.)
This setting will change the runtime estimation reported by the UPS.

*battlow =* 'value'::
Set minimum battery voltage just before the UPS automatically shuts down. (Not available on some hardware.)

*output_phase_angle =* 'value'::
Changes output phase angle to the provided value [000, 120, 180, 240]° (Not available on some hardware.)


UPS CAPABILITY SETTINGS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*reset_to_default*::
Reset capability options and their voltage and frequency limits to safe default values. (*Doable only when the UPS is in Standby Mode*) (Not available on some hardware.)

These UPSes can be fine-tuned to suit your needs enabling or disabling the following options (the driver should tell you which one the UPS is capable of on startup):

*alarm_control =* 'string'::
Enable or disable alarm (BEEP!) [enabled/disabled] (Not available on some hardware.)
Setable also `on the fly' with *beeper.enable* and *beeper.disable* instant commands.

*bypass_alarm =* 'string'::
Enable or disable alarm (BEEP!) at Bypass Mode [enabled/disabled] (Not available on some hardware.)

*battery_alarm =* 'string'::
Enable or disable alarm (BEEP!) at Battery Mode [enabled/disabled] (Not available on some hardware.)

*auto_reboot =* 'string'::
Enable or disable auto reboot [enabled/disabled] (Not available on some hardware.)
If enabled, the UPS will auto recover when AC power returns.

*bypass_when_off =* 'string'::
Enable or disable bypass when UPS is Off [enabled/disabled] (Not available on some hardware.)
If enabled, AC will directly provide power to connected devices when the UPS is off.

*converter_mode =* 'string'::
Enable or disable Converter Mode [enabled/disabled] (Not available on some hardware.)

*eco_mode =* 'string'::
Enable or disable ECO Mode [enabled/disabled] (Not available on some hardware.)
When input voltage/frequency are within acceptable range, the UPS will bypass voltage to output for energy saving. PFC and INVERTER are still active at this mode.

*advanced_eco_mode =* 'string'::
Enable or disable Advanced ECO Mode [enabled/disabled] (Not available on some hardware.)
When input voltage/frequency are within acceptable range, the UPS will bypass voltage to output for energy saving. PFC and INVERTER are off at this mode.

*energy_saving =* 'string'::
Enable or disable Green power function [enabled/disabled] (Not available on some hardware.)
If enabled, for energy saving, the UPS will auto off when there is no load.

*battery_open_status_check =* 'string'::
Enable or disable Battery Open Status Check [enabled/disabled] (Not available on some hardware.)
If enabled, when the UPS is turned on, it will check if the battery is connected or not.

*cold_start =* 'string'::

If enabled, the UPS can be turned on also if AC is not connected to the UPS.

*outlet_control =* 'string'::
Enable or disable programmable outlets control at battery mode [enabled/disabled] (Not available on some hardware.)
If enabled, the UPS will cut off programmable outlets after backup setting time arrive. If disabled, the UPS will provide continuous power to programmable outlets until the battery is running out.

OPTIONS SPECIFIC FOR P31 UPSES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following options are available only on P31 UPSes.

*batt_type =* 'string'::
Battery type for P31 UPSes [Li/Flooded/AGM]

*work_range_type =* 'string'::
Device grid working range for P31 UPSes [Appliance/UPS]

TESTING
~~~~~~~

This driver comes with a couple of functions that are not enabled by default because of the lack of knowledge of some part of the communication protocol used by these UPSes by your friendly neighborhood developer.
Since these functions are supposed to be queries to UPS for some kind of informations, they _should_ not make your UPS go boom. So if you are brave enough to risk your UPS and attached devices' life to help the developers, this will be very appreciated.. *Do it at your own risk*.

*testing*::
If invoked the driver will exec also commands that still need testing

USB INTERFACE ONLY
------------------

*vendorid =* 'regex'::
*productid =* 'regex'::
*vendor =* 'regex'::
*product =* 'regex'::
*serial =* 'regex'::

Select a specific UPS, in case there is more than one connected via USB. Each option specifies an extended regular expression (see *regex(7)*) that must match the UPS's entire vendor/product/serial string (minus any surrounding whitespace), or the whole 4-digit hexadecimal code for vendorid and productid. Try *-DD* for finding out the strings to match.

.USB Configuration Example:
====
    -x vendor="Foo.Corporation.*"
    -x vendorid=051d    # (APC)
    -x product=".*(Smart|Back)-?UPS.*"
====

*bus =* 'regex'::
Select a UPS on a specific USB bus or group of busses. The argument is a regular expression that must match the bus name where the UPS is connected (e.g. bus="002", bus="00[2-3]").

*subdriver =* 'string'::
Select a serial-over-USB subdriver to use. So far the only available choice is *cypress*.
When using this option, it is mandatory to also specify the *vendorid* and *productid*.

UPS WARNINGS
------------

These UPSes report warnings through a 64bit flag (bit1bit2...bit63bit64) where 1 means that a warning arose, while 0 means no warning.
Since more than one warning at a time can be signaled, and because of the limited space in the ups.alarm variable, if the length of the warnings exceed that of ups.alarms variable, they will be reported as bits.
If you want to know the explanation of that bit you can either watch the log or see the next table (unlisted bits equal to unknown warnings).

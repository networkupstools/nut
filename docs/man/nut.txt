nut - Overview of the Network UPS Tools (NUT)

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The Network UPS Tools (NUT) project provides a free and open source tool kit
for monitoring and managing different types of power distribution devices,
first released under such name in 1999 and following up from a few earlier
projects.  Since then, NUT has expanded to cover thousands of devices from
hundreds of vendors, and to handle various device types (UPS, ePDU, ATS/STS,
solar, blade server IPMI as a sort of PDU for the blades, etc.) all with
a consistent API and data model, which has since been published as
link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9271[The "UPS management
protocol", Informational RFC 9271].

While the project is in active development to support ever newer devices and
their firmwares, as well as operating system releases, one of the internally
recognized goals is to remain compatible with the systems NUT could have been
once deployed on: even if vendors of those boxes and operating systems no
longer exist, the venerable hardware deserves to be still protected with
new UPS devices.

Although the original development involved POSIX-compliant operating systems,
over time NUT for Windows support was also implemented (however as of NUT
release v2.8.3, it remains not 100% complete) so it is possible to run the
whole server and client stack as native Windows programs.

Most operating systems deliver NUT as packages built from a certain release,
which for the project is just a better-tested snapshot of on-going development.
Some OS distribution maintainers pick fixes from later releases to update
their software packages while nominally remaining on the same base line
version that the distribution's major release originally went with. This
allows to balance delivering stable programs with well-known qualities
and minimal downsides for a long stretch of time, but misses out on new
capabilities, features (and yes, new bugs) which the on-going development
regularly adds to the current code base du-jour.

As such, NUT community support for releases (or any other non-current code)
is generally limited to suggestions based on experience, but any fixes happen
on the main development branch (there are no release-tracking branches to port
such solutions into), and custom builds of NUT would be required to apply
them in an end-user environment.  This workflow is highly automated in the
project code base (its recipes and scripts), and the packaged dependencies
or toolkits needed for a build are documented for numerous platforms (see
links at the end of this page).

Thanks to this, the NUT project is also a wider open-source community leader
and reference in the area of build recipes and testing automation for
low-level multi-platform Autotools/C/C++ projects in general.

NUT Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The project follows a multi-tiered architecture which may seem a bit complex,
but allows for flexibility with very different real-life setups to handle.
In practice, this involves numerous programs (and their configuration files)
running on the same or different systems (the "network" part in the name).

Many deployment scenarios are explored in the famous
link:https://github.com/networkupstools/ConfigExamples/releases/latest/download/ConfigExamples.pdf[NUT
Configuration Examples] book maintained by Roger Price.

NUT Drivers
^^^^^^^^^^^

The lowest tier comprises 'NUT drivers', which are programs that can talk a
particular protocol over certain media.  Some protocols follow an industry
standard (like USB HID or SNMP), or are dialects of a de-facto standard (like
the originally Megatec "Q*" family of protocols used by many other vendors),
but many others are vendor-specific.  Some devices support several media
connection types (e.g. Serial and/or USB ports, and/or SNMP for networked
management), so there may be several suitable NUT drivers to choose from.

The NUT drivers are responsible for translation between NUT standard data
point or instant command names and whatever strings need to be pulled for
that particular device.  The data is exposed to other programs on the same
machine following the 'NUT Driver/Server Socket Protocol', which relies on
operating system access controls for the UNIX local socket file or a Windows
named pipe.

For each monitored power distribution device, a NUT driver instance should
be running on a machine that has a communication link to that device.

NOTE: There is currently no support for "multiplexing" information or commands
for devices with multiple-media/multiple-driver access, e.g. to gain redundant
connection or a better data collection than any one driver provides. For some
devices it may be possible to run several drivers independently (probably for
your monitoring system to cherry-pick data points from one driver or another),
while others might only enable any one link exclusively.

NUT Data Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A 'NUT Data Server' (linkman:upsd[8]) represents one or more NUT drivers that
run on the same machine as itself, to provide networked access to their data
or pass around the instant command requests and replies.

On one side the data server connects to one or more UNIX local socket files
or Windows named pipes (one for each running driver), and on another side it
listens on the TCP/IP network (port '3493' by default) to communicate with
local or remote client programs.  It is also responsible for communication
security for driver access, whether by defining the NUT user account names
and assigned protocol access permissions (for value-setting or commands;
read access is anonymous), or by handling the TLS/SSL part where enabled.

NUT Clients
^^^^^^^^^^^

Practical work visible to end-users is done by a multitude of 'NUT clients',
many of which are delivered by the project itself and more are created and
maintained by the community at large.  Some standard clients of note include:

* linkman:upsmon[8] is a daemon to monitor primarily the states of UPSes
  (as opposed to other device types that NUT can handle) which power some
  power source units of this particular system, and based on how many PSUs
  are required for the system to run -- initiates a local shutdown when too
  many UPSes are not in a healthy condition.  Instances of this client allow
  a single UPS powering a whole rack or desk of computers to be seen by each
  of them (through a data server running on one of them, on a machine actually
  connected to the UPS -- the "primary" system).
+
NOTE: The `upsmon` client typically splits into two processes: an unprivileged
  one running with credentials of its `RUN_AS_USER` configured in the
  linkman:upsmon.conf[5] file (or a built-in/packaged default like `nut`,
  `monuser` or `nobody`) which does most of the work (including notification
  scripts called via `NOTIFYCMD` setting), and the part which remains owned
  by `root` to initiate the system shutdown by calling `SHUTDOWNCMD` when/if
  the time comes.
+
NUT deployments which desire higher-fidelity control (e.g. different systems
  shutting down after different time spent on battery) often couple the
  linkman:upsmon[8] with linkman:upssched[8] as their `NOTIFYCMD` handler.
+
The "primary" system is usually also responsible for commanding the managed
  UPS to shut itself down and power up when the "wall power" returns (or to
  reset the load if it is already back), subject to UPS hardware capabilities.
  Most client integrations also stall the ultimate reboot/power-off of their
  machine, if its shut down was triggered by `upsmon`, and reboot after a
  long delay (if the machine is still alive).
  This combined approach allows to avoid the "power race condition", when
  systems would otherwise remain shut down indefinitely (until someone comes
  and reboots them) just because external power returned when the shut down
  spree had already started.

* linkman:upsc[1] is a command-line client for anonymous read-only access,
  used to list devices served by a NUT data server, or to query data points
  reported by a particular device.
* linkman:NUT-Monitor[1] is a GUI client for read-only or read-write access.
* A suite of CGI clients can run on a web server like Apache or nginx to
  provide a simple HTML interface to your devices.

Many monitoring systems integrate with NUT (and through it -- with a varied
assortment of power devices), using either simple clients like `upsc` or
`upslog`, or libraries and bindings provided by the project itself (e.g.
C, C++, Python, Java in a nearby repository) or by third-party efforts
(e.g. Perl, Go, C#, REST API).


NUT Run-time Nuances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For many more notes, please see the Frequently Asked Questions document in
NUT sources or on the web site.  A copy may be delivered by your packaging.

"File or directory not found" messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When NUT daemon programs start, they check for existence of certain files
they would create themselves (PID files, local sockets, etc.) and report
when such file does not exist.  Similarly, some programs try to signal an
earlier instance (if the PID is known) and would report if that failed.

While this does look scary and confusing to people who use NUT for the first
time and it greets them with what looks like error messages (we did work on
improving the wording during the NUT v2.8.x release lineage due to frequent
questions), these messages are in fact just a troubleshooting aspect that
is useful at that point in program life cycle: if you expect "other" program
instances to be running when they are not seen, this message helps catch the
error.  If this is a first run, so no "other" program instance's artifacts
should be there, the message says just that.  If your program starts and
sees an older instance already running, further behavior depends on the
situation (e.g. did you start a copy to signal the already running daemon
with some command? did you start a new copy and so any old one is assumed
stuck and should be terminated automatically?)

The "directory" part of the wording, which may be present in these messages,
comes from the standard system library.  It does not mean you should blindly
create a directory (or any other object) for the file names listed in such
reports.

That said, NUT does use directories (known in code and the `configure` script
options as `--with-pidpath`, `--with-altpidpath` and `--with-statepath`)
which should be created and assigned certain permissions each (the latter
two may overlap).  Generally this is done either by packaging, or by manual
steps according to documentation when building NUT from sources.  On some
platforms (e.g. Linux with systemd and its `systemd-tmpfiles` subsystem) they
may be maintained at run-time by configuration files delivered to the system.

The message can also be seen from linkman:upsmon[8] being unable to populate
the `POWERDOWNFLAG` if the location it points to (`/etc/killpower` by default)
does not exist or is read-only, or from a late shutdown integration script like
the `nutshutdown` hook if that location was un-mounted by the time it runs.
It is recommended to store that file on a volatile file system (under `/run`
on most modern distributions; typically the `pidpath` is located there too),
which remains until reboot and disappears during reboot.

User/Group Accounts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Generally NUT daemon programs avoid running as a highly-privileged `root`
account (on POSIX platforms), and drop privileges to run as the configured
user and group accounts such as `nut:nut`.

* One notable exception is the linkman:upsmon[8] daemon which splits into
  a `root`-owned process which may trigger the OS shutdown routine, and an
  unprivileged process which does everything else.

File system permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When using NUT drivers with local communications media (USB or Serial ports),
you must ensure that the unprivileged run-time account like `nut:nut` is
allowed access to those device file system nodes.  On many platforms this
can be automated with subsystems like 'udev', 'devd', 'hotplug', 'upower';
on others (older ones) you may have to `chmod`/`chown`/`chgrp` particular
devfs nodes (whether on the persistent filesystem, or using an init-script
for volatile implementations).

Note that there are several run-time locations for data and socket files of
NUT's privileged and unprivileged programs, and for configuration files.
Access to these directories and individual files should be secured according
to NUT documentation; NUT daemons will warn about lax permissions in their
syslog or console messages. Generally, `root:nut` and `0640` permissions
are correct for most of the files (so the run-time NUT programs may only
read them but can not rewrite them, not even if there happens to be an
exploitable code problem discovered in them over time).

It is also important to note that (except for linkman:upslog[8]) no NUT
daemons leave log files on their own: they send syslog messages, or write
to stdout/stderr, and either or both of these streams can be saved to disk
by the OS service integration (or a redirection from an init-script).

NUT Drivers as Service instances
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting with NUT v2.8.0, on systems with service management frameworks
(like Linux systemd or Solaris/illumos SMF) you may be even inadvertently
using the linkman:nut-driver-enumerator[8] (also known as "NDE") facility.
This is a script, which may be also called automatically (via packaging on
supported platforms) at start-up or may be running continuously as a service,
to process the linkman:ups.conf[5] file and maintain the service units
(with their dependencies) for each driver section separately.

This sometimes raises eyebrows when end-users try to manually start a NUT
driver program (either directly or using linkman:upsdrvctl[8] tool), and
this either fails (because the device is already busy) or gets to conflict
with the copy of the driver running as a service instance, and they begin
to terminate each other.

Configuring NUT Drivers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To get started with the NUT server system, you should populate the
linkman:ups.conf[5] file with a section per device, which informs both the
respective drivers, and tools like service-aware linkman:upsdrvsvcctl[8]
and linkman:nut-driver-enumerator[8] or the legacy linkman:upsdrvctl[8],
and the linkman:upsd[8] data server, to name a few.

In many typical cases, the linkman:nut-scanner[8] tool can get you started
by discovering supported USB, Serial, SNMP, NetXML, IPMI devices, or remote
NUT deployments using Avahi mDNS or the good old port-knocking scan.
This tool would propose a complete section content that you can copy-paste
into your `ups.conf` file (possibly review and adapt the contents first,
to e.g. add a description meaningful to you like "UPS in garage", etc.)

Other configuration files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NUT sample configuration files (packaged or seen in sources under
https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/tree/master/conf directory)
start with a heading comment about the minimal set of their required
options.  Note that many of these files can contain credentials
(either for NUT roles, or for networked power devices as part of
their NUT driver section configuration) and so these files and any
of their backup copies should be secured accordingly.

The linkman:nut.conf[5] may be used by init-scripts or other system
integration code (it notably contains the `MODE` setting to choose
which profile of NUT services to start or not on this particular
system).

On the NUT server you would need at least minimally configured:
linkman:ups.conf[5], linkman:upsd.conf[5], linkman:upsd.users[5].

On the majority of NUT clients (meaning each system monitoring the
UPS state so it knows when to trigger its local shutdown), you would
need linkman:upsmon.conf[5] and depending on your setup, may need a
custom `NOTIFYCMD` or `SHUTDOWNCMD` (if you script something complex),
and/or linkman:upssched.conf[5] and a custom `CMDSCRIPT` for it.

For NUT CGI clients several files may need to be adapted and placed
into certain directories according to their documentation:
linkman:hosts.conf[5] and linkman:upsset.conf[5] for configuration,
and `upsstats-single.html` and `upsstats.html` for HTML UI templates.

Other clients, whether delivered by NUT project (linkman:NUT-Monitor[1]
GUI) or co-located (link:https://github.com/networkupstools/wmnut[WMNut])
or third-party (see https://networkupstools.org/projects.html) would
probably support saving their settings or "favorites".  Do not forget
to secure access to those files and their copies as well.

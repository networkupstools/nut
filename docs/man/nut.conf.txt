NAME
----

nut.conf - UPS definitions for Network UPS Tools

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This file attempts to standardize the various files being found
in different installations, like /etc/default/nut on Debian based
systems and /etc/sysconfig/ups on RedHat based systems.

Distribution's init script should source this file in order to
determine which components have to be started.

Blank lines are ignored. Lines with a hash ('#') character at the
1st position of the line are ignored, too.  They can be used to add
comments.

IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------

This file is intended to be sourced by shell scripts.
You MUST NOT use spaces around the equal sign!

Refer to the EXAMPLE section for illustrations.

DIRECTIVES
----------

*MODE*::
Required.  Recognized values are 'none', 'standalone', 'netserver' and
'netclient'.  Defaults to 'none'.

none;; Indicates that NUT should not get started automatically,
possibly because it is not configured or that an Integrated Power
Management or some external system, is used to startup the NUT
components.

standalone;; Addresses a local only configuration, with 1 UPS
protecting the local system.  This implies to start the 3 NUT
layers (driver, upsd and upsmon), with the related configuration
files.  This mode can also address UPS redundancy.

netserver;; Like the standalone configuration, but also possibly
need one or more specific LISTEN directive(s) in upsd.conf.
Since this MODE is open to the network, a special care should be
applied to security concerns.

netclient;; When only upsmon is required, possibly because
there are other hosts that are more closely attached to the UPS,
the MODE should be set to netclient.

*UPSD_OPTIONS*::
Optional.  Set upsd specific options. See linkman:upsd[8] for more
details.  It is ignored when 'MODE' above indicates that no upsd
should be running.

*UPSMON_OPTIONS*::
Optional.  Set upsmon specific options. See linkman:upsmon[8] for
more details.  It is ignored when 'MODE' above indicates that no
upsmon should be running.

*POWEROFF_WAIT*::
Optional.  At the end of an emergency system halt, the upsmon primary
will signal the UPS to switch off.  This may fail for a number of
reasons.  Most notably is the case that mains power returns during
the shutdown process.  See the section "Power races" in
/usr/share/doc/nut/FAQ.txt.gz.  The system will wait this
long for the UPS to cut power, and then reboot.  It should be long
enough to exhaust the batteries, in case line power continues to be
unavailable.  On the other hand, it should not be so long that the
system remains offline for an unreasonable amount of time if line
power has returned.  See sleep(1) for compatible time syntax.
If you specify the time in seconds, use the "s" suffix.

WARNING: this workaround might be dangerous under some circumstances.
Please read http://bugs.debian.org/358696 for more details.

INTEGRATION
-----------

An init script, such as /etc/init.d/nut, is expected to source this
file in order to determine which components have to be started.

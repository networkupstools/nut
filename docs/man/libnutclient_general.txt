=======================

NAME
----

libnutclient_general, nutclient_destroy, strarr_alloc, strarr_free -
General and utility functions in Network UPS Tools high-level client
access library

SYNOPSIS
--------

	#include <nutclient.h>

	typedef void* NUTCLIENT_t;

	void nutclient_destroy(NUTCLIENT_t client);

	typedef char** strarr;

	strarr strarr_alloc(unsigned short count);

	void strarr_free(strarr arr);

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The *nutclient_destroy()* function destroys a 'NUTCLIENT_t' or derived
(like 'NUTCLIENT_TCP_t') connection object, and frees allocated memory.

The *strarr* type represents an array of C strings (array of char pointer).
The array must always be terminated by a NULL pointer.
Pointed strings must be allocated by (x)calloc or (x)strdup.

The *strarr_alloc()* function allocates a 'strarr' array with the specified
number of (non-initialized) string pointers.
Another additional pointer set to 0 is added at the end of the array.

The *strarr_free* function frees a 'strarr' array.
It also frees all pointed strings.

'dev' is the device name.

UPSCLI_INIT(3)
==============

NAME
----

upscli_init - Initialize upsclient module specifying security properties.

SYNOPSIS
--------

 #include <upsclient.h>

 int upscli_init(int certverify, const char *certpath,
			const char *certname, const char *certpasswd);

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *upscli_init()* function initialize upsclient module and set many
SSL-related properties: 'certverify' to 1 makes certificate verification
required for all SSL connections and 'certpath' is the location of
certificate database.

If compiled with OpenSSL, certpath refers to directory containing
certificates where the certificates must be named according to their
hash values ending in a ".0" extension. If two certificates result in
the same hash value (thus file name), the ".0" can be incremented to ".1"
and so on, as needed. The bash command for creating links in this manner
would be:

ln -s ca.pem ./$(openssl x509 -hash -noout -in ca.pem).0

Alternatively, the c_rehash utility (provided by openssl-perl) can take a
directory and iterate it to link all certificates found in that directory,
in the manner described above.

If compiled with NSS, certpath refers to a directory
containing database files.

If compiled with NSS and using SSL, you can specify 'certname' the name
of the certificate to send to upsd and 'certpasswd' the password used
to decrypt certificate private key.

You can call linkman:upscli_add_host_cert[3] to register specific host
security policy before initialize connections to them.

You must call linkman:upscli_cleanup[3] when exiting application.

RETURN VALUE
------------

The *upscli_init()* function returns 1 on success, or -1 if an error occurs.

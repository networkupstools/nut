MGE-UTALK(8)
============

NAME
----

mge-utalk - Driver for MGE UPS SYSTEMS UTalk protocol equipment

SYNOPSIS
--------

*mge-utalk* -h

*mge-utalk* -a 'UPS_NAME' ['OPTIONS']

NOTE: This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
mge-utalk driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

mge-utalk supports the following legacy units, using the MGE UTalk protocol:

* Pulsar ESV+
* Pulsar ES+
* Pulsar EL
* Pulsar EX
* Pulsar EXtreme
* Comet EXtreme
* Comet (Utalk Serial Card, ref 66060)
* Galaxy (Utalk Serial Card, ref 66060)

This driver also support some newer models with backward UTalk compatibility,
such as Pulsar Evolution and Pulsar EXtreme C. As these models also support
the SHUT protocol, prefer mge-shut for serial communication, or use the USB
port, if available, with the usbhid-ups driver.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver supports the following optional settings in the linkman:ups.conf[5]:

*lowbatt*='num'::
Set the low battery warning threshold at which shutdown is initiated by
linkman:upsmon[8].
+
The factory default value is 30 (in percent), and can be settable depending on
the exact model.

*offdelay*='num'::
Set the timer before the UPS is turned off after the kill power command is
sent (via the *-k* switch).
+
The default value is 20 (in seconds).

*ondelay*='num'::
Set the delay before the UPS is turned on, after the power returns.
+
The default value is 1 (in minutes).

*oldmac*::
Set this flag if you are running Linux on an Oldworld Macintosh box
(all beige Apple Macintosh). This might also be needed for other
OSs (like *BSD) running on PowerMac.

KNOWN ISSUES
------------

Repetitive timeout and staleness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Older models, such as ES/ESV ones, might report repetitive "data stale" errors.
This is due to the fact that these models don't support too much polling.
To solve this problem, add "pollinterval=20" in ups.conf, and change the value
of MAXAGE to 25 in upsd.conf, and DEADTIME to 25 in upsmon.conf.

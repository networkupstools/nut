NAME
----

oneac - Driver for Oneac UPS equipment

SYNOPSIS
--------

*oneac* -h

*oneac* -a 'UPS_NAME' ['OPTIONS']

NOTE: This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
oneac driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

This driver supports various Oneac UPS families:

 - EG (late 80s, early 90s, plug-in serial interface card)
 - ON (early and mid-90s, plug-in serial interface card)
 - OZ (mid-90s on, DB-25 std., interface slot)
 - OB (early 2000's on, big cabinet, DB-25 std., interface slot)

If your UPS is equipped with the Basic Interface card, use the
linkman:genericups[8] driver.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver supports the following optional settings in the
linkman:ups.conf[5] file:

*testtime*='num'::
Change battery test time from the 2 minute default.

*offdelay*='num'::
Change shutdown delay time from 0 second default.

INSTANT COMMANDS
----------------

This driver supports the following Instant Commands.
(See linkman:upscmd[8])

All UPS units
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*shutdown.return*::
Turn off the load possibly after a delay and return when power is back.

*shutdown.stop*::
Stop a shutdown in progress.

*shutdown.reboot*::
Shut down the load briefly while rebooting the UPS.

*test.failure.start*::
Starts a 15 second long simulation of an input power
failure.

*test.battery.start.quick*::
Start a "quick" battery test.  The default time is 2 minutes.  This
time can be set in the *ups.conf* file.  See *testime* above.

*test.battery.stop*::
Stops a battery test that is in progress.

All ON UPS units
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*reset.input.minmax*::
Reset the minimum and maximum input line voltage values
seen since the last reset or power on.

Newer ON UPS units
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*test.panel.start*::
Start testing the UPS panel.

*test.battery.start.deep*::
Start a "deep" battery test.  This test runs the UPS until the low
battery point and then returns to the AC line.

*reset.input.minmax*::
Reset the minimum and maximum input line voltage values
seen since the last reset or power on.

*beeper.enable*::
Enable UPS beeper/buzzer.

*beeper.disable*::
Disable UPS beeper/buzzer.

*beeper.mute*::
Mutes the UPS beeper/buzzer for the current alarm condition(s).

Writable Variables
------------------

See linkman:upsrw[8] to see what variables are writable for the UPS.

NOTE: If your UPS supports writing `battery.runtime.low`, the new set value
is to be entered in minutes (up to '99') but the reported value is reported
in seconds (set 'value * 60').

NOTE: If your UPS supports `input.transfer.low` and `input.transfer.high`,
those values are used to create an allowable output range.  The UPS
will do what it can to keep the output voltage value within the
defined range (for example: tap change or switch to inverter).

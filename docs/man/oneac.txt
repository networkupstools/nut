NAME
----

oneac - Driver for Oneac UPS equipment

NOTE
----

This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
oneac driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

This driver supports various Oneac UPS families:

 - EG (late 80s, early 90s, plug-in serial interface card)
 - ON (early and mid-90s, plug-in serial interface card)
 - OZ (mid-90s on, DB-25 std., interface slot)
 - OB (early 2000's on, big cabinet, DB-25 std., interface slot)

If your UPS is equipped with the Basic Interface card, use the
linkman:genericups[8] driver.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver supports the following optional settings in the
linkman:ups.conf[5] file:

*testtime*='num'::
Change battery test time from the 2 minute default.

*offdelay*='num'::
Change shutdown delay time from 0 second default.

INSTANT COMMANDS
----------------

This driver supports the following Instant Commands.
(See linkman:upscmd[8])

All UPS units
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*shutdown.return*::
Turn off the load possibly after a delay and return when power is back.

*shutdown.stop*::
Stop a shutdown in progress.

*shutdown.reboot*::
Shut down the load briefly while rebooting the UPS.

*test.failure.start*::
Starts a 15 second long simulation of an input power
failure.

*test.battery.start.quick*::
Start a "quick" battery test.  The default time is 2 minutes.  This
time can be set in the *ups.conf* file.  See *testime* above.

*test.battery.stop*::
Stops a battery test that is in progress.

All ON UPS units
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*reset.input.minmax*::
Reset the minimum and maximum input line voltage values
seen since the last reset or power on.

Newer ON UPS units
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*test.panel.start*::
Start testing the UPS panel.

*test.battery.start.deep*::
Start a "deep" battery test.  This test runs the UPS until the low
battery point and then returns to the AC line.

*reset.input.minmax*::
Reset the minimum and maximum input line voltage values
seen since the last reset or power on.

*beeper.enable*::
Enable UPS beeper/buzzer.

*beeper.disable*::
Disable UPS beeper/buzzer.

*beeper.mute*::
Mutes the UPS beeper/buzzer for the current alarm condition(s).

Writable Variables
------------------

See linkman:upsrw[8] to see what variables are writable for the UPS.

NOTE: If your UPS supports writing battery.runtime.low, the new set value
is to be entered in minutes (up to 99) but the reported value is reported
in seconds (set value * 60).

NOTE: If your UPS supports input.transfer.low and input.transfer.high,
those values are used to create an allowable output range.  The UPS
will do what it can to keep the output voltage value within the
defined range (for example: tap change or switch to inverter).

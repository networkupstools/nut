NUT-Monitor(8)
==============

NAME
----

NUT-Monitor, NUT-Monitor-py2gtk2, NUT-Monitor-py3qt5 - Python UI Client for NUT

SYNOPSIS
--------

*NUT-Monitor-py2gtk2*

*NUT-Monitor-py3qt5*

[PREFER_PY2=true] [PYTHON2=python2.7] [PYTHON3=python3.14w] *NUT-Monitor*

DESCRIPTION
-----------

These programs comprise the NUT-Monitor Python UI Client for NUT with
two similar implementations for major Python UI ecosystems still seen
in practical deployments. For communications with a NUT data server,
both rely on the 'PyNUTClient' module (compatible with both Python 2.x
and 3.x) provided by NUT sources that can be installed by your packaging
as part of NUT; also releases of the module are published as a PyPI package.

* `NUT-Monitor-py2gtk2` is an implementation that relies on a Python 2.x
  interpreter (tested with 2.6 or 2.7 generation) and GTK2 UI library;

* `NUT-Monitor-py3qt5` is an implementation that relies on a Python 3.x
  interpreter and QT5 UI library;

* `NUT-Monitor` is a shell script to pick at run-time the best implementation.
  In older NUT releases, this was the file name used by the Python 2.x variant
  directly.

Note that depending on your distribution's packaging choices, you may lack
the `NUT-Monitor` shell script and just have one set of the desktop window
manager integration files directly for one particular implementation of the
actual Python UI client.

For each individual run, the UI client can connect to a single NUT data server
and a device on it.  This can use either anonymous read-only connections (like
linkman:upsc[8]), or authenticated connections (see linkman:upsd.users[5])
which can also issue commands to the driver (like linkman:upscmd[8]) and
set supported variables (like linkman:upsrw[8]) -- propagated to the device,
where applicable.

The Python UI client can be used on a system different from the NUT data
server (the one connected to the actual UPS by communications media and
running the NUT driver(s)), and may be using a different OS platform
(including Windows).

NOTE: Do not confuse this graphical NUT client with an unfortunately named
`nut-monitor` service in some packaged distributions, as the name of (or an
alias to) the service wrapping the linkman:upsmon[8] client daemon for your
system shutdown.


EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

These scripts do not support command-line arguments, but the `NUT-Monitor`
shell script can be influence by environment variables `PYTHON2` and/or
`PYTHON3` to provide the program name (or full path name) of your preferred
version for the respective implementation of the Python interpreter. This
program would be tried first when probing for available prerequisites.

The `PREFER_PY2=true` or `PREFER_PY2=false` environment variable value
can be used to select the implementation of the client to use if both
ecosystems are usable on the current system.

Note that the implementation for Python 2.x / GTK2 is slightly better
regarding localization; functionally they should be equivalent.

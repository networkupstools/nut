LIEBERT(8)
==========

NAME
----

liebert - Driver for Liebert contact-closure UPS equipment

NOTE
----

This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
liebert driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

This driver supports some Liebert UPS equipment with a contact-closure
interface.  This includes the UPStation GXT2 with their contact-closure
cable.  The smart mode ("Multilink") cable is not supported by this
driver.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver does not support any extra settings in the
linkman:ups.conf[5].

BUGS
----

This driver does not yet support shutdowns by raising DTR.  Be aware
that shutdowns are not possible with the stock contact-closure cable.
You may have to build another cable with DTR connected through to the
UPS for it to work.

There is no way for this driver to detect the hardware or cable.  It
will start up successfully even if no UPS is present.  This is a
fundamental limitation of any contact-closure driver.

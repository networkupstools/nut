NUTDRV_ATCL_USB(8)
==================

NAME
----

nutdrv_atcl_usb - Driver for 'ATCL FOR UPS' equipment

SYNOPSIS
--------

*nutdrv_atcl_usb* -h

*nutdrv_atcl_usb* -a 'UPS_NAME' ['OPTIONS']

NOTE: This man page only documents the specific features of the nutdrv_atcl_usb
driver.  For information about the core driver, see linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

This driver is for UPS hardware which identifies itself as USB idVendor +0001+
and idProduct +0000+, and iManufacturer +ATCL FOR UPS+.  Known manufacturers
include Kanji and Plexus.

The UPS interface seems to be a generic USB-to-serial chip, and for
hardware manufactured by Kanji and Plexus, the microcontroller
appears to emulate a traditional contact-closure interface. This translates
into only three states in ups.status: *OL*, *OB* and *OB LB* (similar to
linkman:genericups[8]), with no other dynamic status values reported.

Note that these USB identifiers (including the iManufacturer string)
have also been seen on devices that are supported by the `fuji`
subdriver of linkman:nutdrv_qx[8], and some others.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver supports the following optional setting:

*vendor =* 'name'::

In case your iManufacturer (Vendor) string does not exactly match
+ATCL FOR UPS+, you may provide an alternate string here (or specify "NULL" if
the device does not provide a vendor string but you want this driver to match).
+
Note that a more likely case for mismatch is that your device is handled by
another driver for +0001:0000+ devices, such as linkman:nutdrv_qx[8].
+
NOTE: This driver does not intend to support USB-matching settings common to
other drivers, such as *vendorid*, *product*, *productid*, *serial*, *device*
or *bus*; also the *vendor* setting supported here is not a regular expression.

BUGS
----

The UPS returns the same code for "load power is off" as for "on line power".
This condition will not be observed if the NUT `upsmon` in primary mode runs
on the box powered by the UPS, but may be an issue if the UPS is monitored
by a remote (secondary) system.

The time between the shutdown command and removal of power seems to be fixed at
30 seconds. Ensure that the NUT shutdown script is invoked as late as possible
in the shutdown procedure (in case some services take longer than others to
clean up).

Most contact-closure UPSes will not power down the load if the line power is
present. This can create a race when using secondary linkman:upsmon[8]
systems. See the linkman:upsmon[8] man page for more information.
The solution to this problem is to upgrade to a smart protocol UPS of some
kind that allows detection and proper load cycling on command.

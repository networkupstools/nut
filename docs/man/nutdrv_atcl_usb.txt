NUTDRV_ATCL_USB(8)
==================

NAME
----
nutdrv_atcl_usb - Driver for 'ATCL FOR UPS' equipment

NOTE
----
This man page only documents the specific features of the nutdrv_atcl_usb 
driver.  For information about the core driver, see linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------
This driver is for UPS hardware which identifies itself as USB idVendor 0001
and idProduct 0000, and iManufacturer +ATCL FOR UPS+.  Known manufacturers
include Kanji and Plexus. The UPS interface seems to be a generic USB-to-serial
chip, and for hardware manufactured by Kanji and Plexus, the microcontroller
appears to emulate a traditional contact-closure interface. This translates
into only three states in ups.status: *OL*, *OB* and *OB LB* (similar to
linkman:genericups[8]), with no other dynamic status values reported. Note that
these USB identifiers (including the iManufacturer string) have also been seen
on devices that are supported by the `fuji` subdriver of linkman:nutdrv_qx[8].

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver supports the following optional setting:

*vendor*='name'::
In case your iManufacturer (Vendor) string does not exactly match
+ATCL FOR UPS+, you may provide an alternate string here. Note that a more
likely case is that your device is handled by another driver for +0001:0000+
devices, such as linkman:nutdrv_qx[8].

BUGS
----
The UPS returns the same code for "load power is off" as for "on line power".
This condition will not be observed if the NUT master is powered by the UPS,
but may be an issue if the UPS is monitored by a remote system.

The time between the shutdown command and removal of power seems to be fixed at
30 seconds. Ensure that the NUT shutdown script is invoked as late as possible
in the shutdown procedure (in case some services take longer than others to
clean up).

Most contact-closure UPSes will not power down the load if the line power 
is present. This can create a race when using slave linkman:upsmon[8] systems.
See the linkman:upsmon[8] man page for more information. The solution to this
problem is to upgrade to a smart protocol UPS of some kind that allows
detection and proper load cycling on command.

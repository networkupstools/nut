NUTDRV_ATCL_USB(8)
==================

NAME
----
nutdrv_atcl_usb - Driver for 'ATCL FOR UPS' equipment

NOTE
----
This man page only documents the specific features of the nutdrv_atcl_usb 
driver.  For information about the core driver, see linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------
This driver is for UPS hardware which identifies itself as USB idVendor 0001
and idProduct 0000, and iManufacturer 'ATCL FOR UPS'.  Known manufacturers
include Kanji and Plexus. The UPS interface seems to be a USB frontend to a
traditional contact-closure interface, which translates into only three states
in ups.status: *OL*, *OB* and *OB LB*.  See also linkman:genericups[8].

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver also supports the following optional setting:

*vendor*='name'::
In case your iManufacturer string does not exactly match +ATCL FOR UPS+, you
may provide an alternate string here. Note that a more likely case is that your
device is handled by another driver for 0001:0000 devices, such as
linkman:nutdrv_qx[8].

BUGS
----
The UPS returns the same code for "load power is off" as for "on line power".
This condition will not be observed if the NUT master is powered by the UPS,
but may be an issue if the UPS is monitored by a remote system.

Most contact-closure UPSes will not power down the load if the line power 
is present. (In fact, with this hardware, the supposed "shutdown" command seems
to have no effect at all.) This can create a race when using slave
linkman:upsmon[8] systems.  See the linkman:upsmon[8] man page for more
information.

The solution to this problem is to upgrade to a smart protocol UPS of some kind
that allows detection and proper load cycling on command.

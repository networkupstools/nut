BELKIN(8)
=========

NAME
----
  
belkin - Driver for Belkin serial UPS equipment

NOTE
----

This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
belkin driver.  For information about the core driver, see  
linknut:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------
The *belkin* driver is known to support the Regulator Pro 525 (F6C525-SER).
Other similar models such as the 425 and 625 should also work.

The Trust UPS and older Belkin units are not supported.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver does not support any extra settings in the    
linknut:ups.conf[5].

BUGS
----

There are dragons lurking within the protocol to this UPS.  I have one
that essentially behaves like a glorified power strip due to some
invasive probing on my part.  Don't mess with it directly.

NOTE: the driver doesn't go anywhere near these character sequences,
so it won't zap your UPS.  I only mention this here as yet another
reminder of the perils of closed hardware.

BELKIN(8)
=========

NAME
----

belkin - Driver for Belkin serial UPS equipment

SYNOPSIS
--------

*belkin* -h

*belkin* -a 'UPS_NAME' ['OPTIONS']

NOTE: This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
belkin driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

The *belkin* driver is known to support the Regulator Pro 525 (F6C525-SER).
Other similar models such as the 425 and 625 should also work.

The Trust UPS and older Belkin units are not supported.

This driver only supports serial connections. If your UPS has a USB port,
please consult the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) to see which of the USB
drivers you should use.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver does not support any extra settings in the
linkman:ups.conf[5].

BUGS
----

There are dragons lurking within the protocol to this UPS.  I have one
that essentially behaves like a glorified power strip due to some
invasive probing on my part.  Don't mess with it directly.

NOTE: the driver doesn't go anywhere near these character sequences,
so it won't zap your UPS.  I only mention this here as yet another
reminder of the perils of closed hardware.

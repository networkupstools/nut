MUST_EP2000Pro(8)
===============

NAME
----

must_ep2000pro - Driver for MUST EP2000Pro UPS with
RS-232 serial Modbus connection.

SYNOPSIS
--------

*must_ep2000pro* -h

*must_ep2000pro* -a 'DEVICE_NAME' ['OPTIONS']

NOTE: This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
must_ep2000pro driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

This driver supports MUST EP2000Pro compatible, line-interactive
UPS with the following characteristics.

1. 12V or 24V external battery

2. Connection: RS-232 or USB (by RS232-To-USB)

Some models that may be covered by this driver:

* Original EP200Pro
* Energy Smart.2
* Luxeon UPS-500ZR
* Bineos EP20-1000 PRO
* any other work with original program from MUST

Currently, it has only been tested on the following model:

* Energy Smart.2 600W

Generally, device doesn't have any identification data, so
autodetection is not possible. Only one documented info is
software version with unknown meaning.

must_ep2000pro uses the libmodbus project, for Modbus implementation.

INSTALLATION
------------

This driver should be built by default if libmodbus and development headers
are available. You can force the `configure` script to build it with the
following arguments:

    :; ./configure --with-serial=yes --with-modbus=yes

You also need to give proper (R/W) permissions on the local serial device
file to allow the NUT driver run-time user to access it. This may need
additional setup for start-up scripting, udev or upower rules, to apply
the rights on every boot -- especially if your device nodes are tracked
by a virtual filesystem.

For example, a USB-to-serial converter can be identified as `/dev/ttyACM0`
or `/dev/ttyUSB0` on Linux, or `/dev/ttyU0` on FreeBSD (note the capital "U").
A built-in serial port can be identified as `/dev/ttyS0` on Linux or one of
`/dev/cua*` names on FreeBSD.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver also supports the following optional settings:

*lowbatt*='num'::
Set the value of battery.charge.low to 'num'. Device itself has only switch off
on low battery voltage.

INSTANT COMMANDS
----------------

This driver supports some instant commands (see linkman:upscmd[8]):

*beeper.enable*::
Enable the UPS beeper

*beeper.disable*::
Disable the UPS beeper

*shutdown.return*::
Turn off the load and wait for the power to return

KNOWN PROBLEMS
--------------

If you run the *shutdown.return* command with mains present it does nothing.
If you run the *shutdown.return* command without mains present it's poweroff
device immediate. No any setting in device documentation for shutdown delay.

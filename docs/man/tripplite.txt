NAME

tripplite - Driver for Tripp-Lite SmartPro UPS equipment

NOTE
----

This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
tripplite driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

This driver should work on the SmartPro line, including the SMART700
and SMART700SER.  It only supports SmartPro models that communicate
using the serial port.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver supports the following optional settings in the
linkman:ups.conf[5]:

*offdelay*='num'::
Time to wait before the UPS is turned off after the kill power command is
sent.  The default value is 64 (in seconds).

*rebootdelay*='num'::
Set the timer before the UPS is cycled after the reboot command is sent.
The default value is 64 (in seconds).

*startdelay*='num'::
Set the time that the UPS waits before it turns itself back on after a
reboot command.  The default value is 60 (in seconds).

KNOWN ISSUES AND BUGS
---------------------

Battery charge information may not be correct for all UPSes.  It is tuned
to be correct for a SMART700SER.  Other models may not provide correct
information.  Information from the manufacturer would be helpful.

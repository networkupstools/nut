NUT.EXE(8)
==========

NAME
----

nut.exe - NUT for Windows wrapper for all-in-one service

SYNOPSIS
--------

*nut.exe* {-h | /?}

*nut.exe* ['OPTIONS']

*nut.exe* (as a service implementation)

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*nut.exe* wraps NUT programs to start and stop as a Windows service.

Depending on 'nut.conf' setting of 'MODE', it would manage the bundle of
driver(s), 'upsd' data server and 'upsmon' client, as well as attempt an
UPS shutdown command in case of FSD handling, or for mere 'netclient' systems
it would run just the 'upsmon' client to monitor remote UPS device(s) and
initiate the OS shut down on the local Windows system as applicable.

Beside launching or stopping a set of the NUT programs in certain cases,
this helper program also allows to register (or un-register) itself as a
Windows service. To actually manage the service from command line you can
execute the Windows `net` command, e.g.:

----
net stop "Network UPS Tools"
net start "Network UPS Tools"
----

You can also execute `nut start` to automatically register the service
(if not yet registered) and start it, and `nut stop` to stop the service
if registered.

OPTIONS
-------

*nut.exe* is currently launched with no arguments when it is intended to
run as the implementation of a registered Windows service; it would error
out otherwise.

*/?*::
Display the help text and exit.

*-h*::
Display the help text and exit.

*-V*::
Display NUT version and exit.

*-D*::
Raise the debug level.  Use this multiple times for additional details.
The non-trivial debug level would be passed down to launched NUT programs.
Primarily useful for troubleshooting with the non-service mode.

*-I*::
Install as a Windows service called "Network UPS Tools".

*-U*::
Uninstall the Windows service.

*-N*::
Run once in non-service mode (for troubleshooting).

*start*::
Install as a Windows service called "Network UPS Tools" (if not yet done),
and try to start this service.

*stop*::
Try to stop a Windows service called "Network UPS Tools".

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------

*nut.exe* should not interact with console message buffers (stdout, stderr)
much, except when explicitly asked to (e.g. displaying help and NUT version,
running with verbose debug mode) or when exiting after an attempted service
initialization while not running in a service context.

Most of normal logging from *nut.exe* goes to the Windows Event Log.

Launched NUT programs may emit messages of their own; their fate when no
console is attached is questionable.

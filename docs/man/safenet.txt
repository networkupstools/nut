SAFENET(8)
==========

NAME
----

safenet - Driver for SafeNet compatible UPS equipment

SYNOPSIS
--------

*safenet* -h

*safenet* -a 'UPS_NAME' ['OPTIONS']

NOTE: This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
safenet driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

This driver supports UPS equipment which can be controlled via
SafeNet v1.0 for Windows (serial interface only).

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver supports the following optional settings in the
linkman:ups.conf[5] file:

*manufacturer=*'value'::
Autodetection of this parameter is not possible yet (and it probably
never will be). Therefore, this user-defined string accepts any name. The
default is 'unknown'.

*modelname=*'value'::
Like manufacturer above. The default is 'unknown'.

*serialnumber=*'value'::
Like manufacturer above. The default is 'unknown'.

*ondelay=*'value'::
Time to wait before switching on the UPS (minutes). Defaults to 1 minute.

*offdelay=*'value'::
Time to wait before shutting down the UPS (seconds). Defaults to 30 seconds.

INSTANT COMMANDS
----------------

This driver supports some instant commands (see linkman:upscmd[8]):

*test.battery.start*::
Start UPS self test

*test.battery.stop*::
Cancel UPS self test

*test.failure.start*::
Start simulated power failure

*test.failure.stop*::
Cancel simulated power failure

*beeper.enable*::
Enable the UPS beeper

*beeper.mute*::
Temporarily mute the UPS beeper

*beeper.toggle*::
Toggle the UPS beeper

*shutdown.return*::
Turn off the load and wait for the power to return. Uses the timer
defined by *offdelay*.

*shutdown.reboot*::
Turn off the load and return. Uses the timers defined by *offdelay*
and *ondelay*.

KNOWN PROBLEMS
--------------

If you run the *shutdown.return* command with mains present, the output
may stay on or switch off and not back on again. The *shutdown.reboot*
command will unconditionally switch on the load again (with or without mains
present).

If the driver is called with the '-k' option (or through *upsdrvctl
shutdown*) it tries to detect which command should be used in an attempt
to stay off until mains is present again or to cycle the output if the
power returned in the mean time. This isn't bullet-proof, and you should be
prepared that the power will either not be shutdown, or that it doesn't
return when the power comes back.

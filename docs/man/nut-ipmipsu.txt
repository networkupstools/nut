NUT-IPMIPSU(8)
==============

NAME
----

nut-ipmipsu - Driver for IPMI Power Supply Units (PSU)

SYNOPSIS
--------

*nut-ipmipsu* -h

*nut-ipmipsu* -a 'PSU_NAME' ['OPTIONS']

NOTE: This driver is experimental, and still a work-in-progress. Feedback is
encouraged.

NOTE: This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
nut-ipmipsu driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------

This driver should support a wide range of PSUs through local IPMI interface.

nut-ipmipsu currently uses the GNU FreeIPMI project, for IPMI implementation.


EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

This driver doesn't support any optional settings.

INSTALLATION
------------

This driver may be not built by default.  You can build it by installing
the libfreeipmi-dev dependencies and using `configure --with-ipmi=yes`.

You also need to give proper permissions on the local IPMI device file
(`/dev/ipmi0` for example) to allow the NUT user to access it.

An *udev* rules file (`nut-ipmipsu.rules`) is provided and automatically
installed on an *udev* enabled system. This file is generally installed
in `/etc/udev/rules.d/`, or `/lib/udev/rules.d/` on newer systems, to
address the permission settings problem.

For more information, refer to `scripts/udev/README.adoc` in NUT sources.

INSTANT COMMANDS
----------------

This driver doesn't support any instant commands.

IMPLEMENTATION
--------------

The `port` value is used to identify the PSU.  For instance, to target
FRU '0x2', use the following in *ups.conf*:

	[pdu]
		driver = nut-ipmipsu
		port = id2

This driver will report various information related to a PSU, including:

 - manufacturer, model, serial and part numbers,
 - nominal voltage and frequency,
 - actual current and voltage,
 - status of the PSU:

   * 'OL' means that the PSU is present and providing power,
   * 'OFF' means that the PSU is present but not providing power
     (power cable removed),
   * 'stale' (no data) means that the PSU is not present (i.e.
     physically removed).

Here is an example output for a Dell r610 server:

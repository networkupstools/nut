UPSSTATS.CGI(8)
===============

NAME
----

upsstats.cgi - Web-based UPS status viewer

SYNOPSIS
--------

*upsstats.cgi*

NOTE: As a CGI program, this should be invoked through your web server.
If you run it from the command line, it will either complain about
unauthorized access or spew a bunch of HTML at you.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*upsstats.cgi*
uses template files to build web pages containing status information
from UPS hardware.  It can repeat sections of those template files to
monitor several UPSes simultaneously, or focus on a single UPS.

These templates can also include references to linkman:upsimage.cgi[8]
for graphical displays of battery charge levels, voltage readings, and
the UPS load.

ACCESS CONTROL
--------------

upsstats will only talk to linkman:upsd[8] servers that have been defined
in your linkman:hosts.conf[5].  If it complains that "Access to that host
is not authorized", check that file first.

TEMPLATES
---------

The web page that is displayed is actually a template containing
commands to `upsstats` which are replaced by status information.

The default file used for the overview of devices is `upsstats.html`.

When monitoring a single UPS, the file displayed is
`upsstats-single.html`.

The format of these files, including the possible commands, is
documented in linkman:upsstats.html[5].

FILES
-----

linkman:hosts.conf[5], linkman:upsstats.html[5], upsstats-single.html

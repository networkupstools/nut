NAME
----
pijuice - driver for UPS in PiJuice HAT

NOTE
----
This man page only documents the hardware-specific features of the
*pijuice* driver.  For information about the core driver, see
linkman:nutupsdrv[8].

NOTE: This manual page was hastily adapted from related `asem` driver
manpage based on information from the original pull request, and so
may not fully apply to PiJuice HAT, patches from experts are welcome.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------
The *pijuice* driver supports the portable PiJuice HAT UPS for Raspberry Pi
embedded PCs.

EXTRA ARGUMENTS
---------------

The required parameter for this driver is the I2C bus name:

*port*='dev-node'::
On the PiJuice HAT, this should be `/dev/i2c-1`.

INSTALLATION
------------
NOTE: This section was copied from `asem` driver manpage and may not fully
apply to PiJuice HAT, patches are welcome.

This driver is specific to the Linux I2C API, and requires the lm_sensors
libi2c-dev or its equivalent to compile.

Beware that the SystemIO memory used by the I2C controller is reserved by ACPI.
If only a native I2C driver (e.g. i2c_i801, as of 3.5.X Linux kernels) is
available, then you'll need to relax the ACPI resources check. For example, you
can boot with the `acpi_enforce_resources=lax` option.

Optional: use DIAGNOSTICS to describe troubleshooting techniques that are
longer than what can be conveniently described in the driver error messages.

KNOWN ISSUES AND BUGS
---------------------
NOTE: This section was copied from `asem` driver manpage and may not fully
apply to PiJuice HAT, patches are welcome.

The driver shutdown function is not implemented, so other arrangements must be
made to turn off the UPS.

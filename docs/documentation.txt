Data dumps for the DDL
----------------------

Note: both developers contributing a driver and users using an existing driver
for device not previously documented as supported by it, are welcome to report
new data for the Devices Dumps Library (DDL) mentioned above. Best of all such
"data dump" reports can be prepared by the

endif::website[]
ifndef::website[]
`./tools/nut-ddl-dump.sh`
endif::website[]
script from the main NUT codebase, and reported on the NUT mailing list or
via link:https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues[NUT issues on GitHub]
or as a pull request against the
link:https://github.com/networkupstools/nut-ddl[NUT Devices Dumps Library]
following the naming and other rules described in the DDL documentation page.

Data dumps collected by the tools above, or by `upsc` client, or by drivers
in exploratory data-dumping mode (with `-d 1` argument), can be compared by

script from the main NUT codebase, which strips away lines with only numeric
values (aiming to minimize the risk of losing meaningful changes like counters).

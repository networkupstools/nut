ONEAC(R) Serial Interface
=========================


Advanced Interface Installation Instructions
--------------------------------------------

ONEAC uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) are the first to offer an open architecture for electronic interfaces.
This allows the user to fully integrate his computer system.
While most systems today typically use the interface from the UPS to shut down automatically following a prolonged outage, these interchangeable interfaces are also capable of informing the computer system of other conditions such as high temperature, over/undervoltage and battery condition.


Installation Instructions '(Not necessary for units with interface already installed)'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Observe Electrostatic-Discharge Precautions:
Keep the interface card in the static-shielded bag until you are ready to complete the installation.
Use a grounded wrist strap at the workstation where you will be installing the interface.
If this is not available, ground yourself by frequently touching the Environmental Reference Ground on the rear of the UPS just before handling the interface card.
Avoid carpeted areas during the installation because they are typically high static areas.

2. Inspect the unit.
Make sure it is the type you need and that it has not suffered damage in shipment.

3. Switch the UPS off and unplug it from the wall.
(Be sure the supported equipment is ready to be shut down.)

4. Remove the interface cover plate on the rear of the UPS by removing the two screws which hold it.
Keep these screws in a safe place.

5. Open the static-shielded bag and remove the interface card.

6. With the component side of the printed circuit board away from the center of the rear panel, slide the interface card into the opening.
Just before the rear plate on the interface card reaches the rear panel of the UPS, the connectors inside will start to touch.
Gently increase pressure and move the interface slightly up and down until the rear plate is flush with the rear panel of the UPS.
Install the two screws (from step 4 above) until snug.
Make sure that the toothed washer is still attached to the screws.
If these screws are lost, they may be obtained from any hardware store.
They are No. 6-32 by 3/8 inch machine screws with No. 6 internal tooth lockwashers.

7. Connect the appropriate cable between the UPS and the host device.

8. Plug the UPS back into the wall and turn it on.


Interface Removal Instructions
------------------------------

1. As during installation, observe Electrostatic-Discharge precautions.

2. Switch the UPS off and unplug it from the wall outlet.

3. Remove the two screws holding the interface to the UPS back plate.

4. Attach a molded cable to the DB25 connector of the interface.

5. Using the hood of the cable as a handle, move the interface up and down slightly while pulling straight back from the UPS.


Interface General Overview '(IF-ARS232 & IF-ARS422)'
----------------------------------------------------

The advanced interface cards send ASCII characters and strings to the computer system.
Configuration of the card is accomplished through DIP switches on the back plate of the interface.
Switch 1 is for baud rate and word configuration.
The two options are 1200, 7 Data, 1 Stop, Even Parity or 9600, 8 Data, 1 Stop, No Parity (default).
Switches 2 & 3 are reserved.
Switch 4 is for disabling the internal buzzer when UPS monitoring is being done from a remote location and there is no need for the local buzzer.
Switches 5 through 8 are for DTE/DCE (RS-232 only, DTE default).
Each setting option is shown on the back plate.
These interfaces will work with both the ONEAC EG and ON series of UPSs although not all of the information is available when used with an EG series UPS.
(See the next chapter for details)

The list below indicates the available information on the interface and how to obtain it.
To receive the entire packet of information, send a *+%+*, CR, LF.
A packet request on an EG series UPS only responds with the first 22 characters of the packet.

All incoming characters EXCEPT "*+X+*" require a trailing CR, LF sequence to be recognized.
Responses from the UPS EXCEPT CURRENT STATUS are followed by a CR, LF sequence.
All request characters are upper case.
Invalid characters or request format returns a "+*+", CR, LF to the host machine.
A valid request that cannot be executed at the time returns a "+#+" to the host.
Periods occupy data positions that have not had an event to load them.

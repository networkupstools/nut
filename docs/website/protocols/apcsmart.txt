APC's smart protocol
====================


Description
-----------

Here's the information on the elusive APC smart signalling protocol used by their higher end units (Back-UPS Pro, Smart-UPS, Matrix-UPS, etc).
What you see here has been collected from a variety of sources.
Some people analyzed the chatter between PowerChute and their hardware.
Others sent various characters to the UPS and figured out what the results meant.


RS-232 differences
------------------

Normal 9 pin serial connections have TxD on 3 and RxD on 2.
APC's smart serial ports put TxD on pin 1 and RxD on pin 2.
This means you go nowhere if you use a normal straight through serial cable.
In fact, you might even power down the load if you plug one of those cables in.
This is due to the odd routing of pins - DTR and RTS from the PC usually wind up driving the on/off line.
So, when you open the port, they go high and \*poof* your computer dies.

Originally link:images/apcsmart_evilhack.jpg[this evil hack] was used to connect the UPS to the PC when this page was first being built.
As you can see, I cheated and neglected the ground (only 2 wires!) and it still worked.
This method can be used for playing around, but for professional systems this is obviously not a viable option.

That hack didn't work out so well (damned cats), so it was retired quite awhile back.
The most practical solution was to go out and BUY the DOS/Win version of Powerchute just for the black (smart) cable.
I recommend doing the same thing if you actually care about this thing working properly.
Of course, if you have one of the newer packages that came with PowerChute, you already have the cable you need.

If you are handy with cable tools, check out these diagrams.
They show how to clone the black "smart" cable that's normally provided with APC models sold after 1996.
The loopback pins (back to the PC) are used to keep PowerChute happy by allowing cable detection.
If you use the NUT apcsmart or newapc drivers, those pins don't matter.


The Smart Protocol
------------------

Despite the lack of official information from APC, this table has been constructed.
It's standard RS-232 serial communications at 2400 bps/8N1.
Don't rush the UPS while transmitting or it may stop talking to you.
This isn't a problem with the normal single character queries, but it really does matter for multi-char things like "*+@000+*".
Sprinkle a few calls to usleep() in your code and everything will work a lot better.

[[cap]]
Capabilities
------------

Upon sending a *+^Z+*, your UPS will probably spit back something like this (truncated here for the example):

----
#uD43132135138129uM43229234239224uA43110112114108 ....
----

It looks bizarre and ugly, but is easily parsed.
The +#+ is some kind of marker/ident character.
Skip it.
The rest fits this form:

- Command character - use this to select the value
- Locale - use *+b+* to find out what yours is, +4+ applies to all
- Number of choices - +4+ means there are 4 possibilities coming up
- Choice length - +3+ means they are all 3 chars long

Then it's followed by the choices, and it starts over.

Matrix-UPS models have +##+ between each grouping for some reason.

General
-------

This document contains specific information regarding the RS232C communication protocol for UPS models built for Best Power and SOLA.
The protocol provides features to allow the user to:

1. Monitor charger status.
2. Monitor battery status and condition.
3. Monitor inverter status.
4. Monitor UPS status.
5. Monitor the utility status.
6. Shut off power to the UPS load
7. Turn off power to the UPS load and allow the power to return after a user-selected amount of time

NOTE: +<cr>+ as used in this document is the IBM PC ASCII code for Carriage Return.
It has the HEX code of +0D+.

The connected computer will control information exchange through a query command followed by +<cr>+.
The UPS is case sensitive to commands received from the connected computer.
The UPS will respond with information followed by a +<cr>+ or a specific action will take place without a serial response.

Some data/functions will be different depending on whether the UPS is a standby or on-line (double-conversion) system.

UPS data will be provided at a rate of 2400 baud and consist of 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, and no parity bit.
All the information is provided in ASCII format.

Standby UPS systems following this specification will be capable of performing a UPS test.
This test will be short term, user specified term, or to a low battery warning.

All system will respond to inverter shut down and output shut down after a specified delay and for specified time.
They will also permit cancellation of the shut down sequence.


Hardware
--------

The DB9S (Female) Communication Port on the UPS must conform to Best Power's BestPort Communication Port Specification.
Reference document number: EPS-0059.

For the communications described in this document, the following pins a functionality are required:

[cols=".^2,.^8",options="header,autowidth",frame="topbot",grid="rows",align="center"]
|====
|Pin |Function
|1

(6 on 610)
|*RS-232 Receive Data*

Receives incoming RS-232 communication data at 2400 baud, 8 bits, no parity and 1 stop bit.
|2

(9 on 610)
|*RS-232 Transmit Data*

Sends outgoing RS-232 communication data at 2400 baud, 8 bits, no parity and 1 stop bit.
|4

(7 on 610)
|*Common*

The signal ground for all signal pins.
|6

(NC on 610)
a|*Reserved _or_ Plug and Play Sense*

UPS Models that support Microsoft Plug and Play (PnP) compatibility use this pin to sense the PnP request from the PC.

Currently, models that have PnP support are the Patriot Pro, Patriot Pro II, SOLA 320, SOLA 325, Fortress 520 Series, SOLA 520, Fortress.TeleCom and SOLA 525.

The 610 series, Axxium, SOLA 620 do not support Plug and Play compatibility.

NOTE: If a new UPS is to support Plug and Play, Best Power software engineers must assign the unique numerical identifiers for the PnP sequence, as well as provide the text identifier for the UPS having the PnP feature.
|====


CABLING
~~~~~~~

Best Power's INT-0062 (SOLA's 0999-3400M3) cable shall be used to connect a PC's DB9P (Male) serial port to the DB9S (Female) port (BestPort) on all models except the 610 series.

The cable used on the 610 series is part number A4D0044. (SOLA's 0999-3403M3)


COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL COMMAND DEFINITIONS

[NOTE]
====
For Offline UPS Models, its purpose is to identify a short duration voltage glitch which has caused an offline UPS to transfer to Inverter mode.
If this occurs, the measured input voltage will appear normal at the query prior to the glitch and will still appear normal during the next query.
The Input Fault Voltage will hold the glitch voltage until the next query.
After the query, the Input Fault Voltage will be the same as the Input Voltage, until the next glitch occurs.

For Online UPS Models, its purpose is to identify a short duration utility failure which has caused the online UPS to transfer to Battery mode.
If this occurs, the measured input voltage will appear normal at the query prior to the utility failure and will still appear normal during the next query.
The Input Fault voltage will hold the utility failure voltage until the next query.
After the query, the Input Fault Voltage will be the same as the Input Voltage, until the next utility fail occurs.

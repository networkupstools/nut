NUT Integration Testing suite
=============================

This suite aims to simplify running `upsd`, a `dummy-ups` driver and
a few clients to query them, as part of regular `make check` routine
or separately with existing binaries (should not impact any existing
installation data, processes or communications).

WARNING: Current working directory when starting the script should be
the location where it may create temporary data (e.g. the BUILDDIR).

it via files in standard path names.
